# Translation of Neural Network from Python to C++

This is a translation of the neural network described in the book, *Neural Networks from Scratch in Python* by Harrison Kinsley & Daniel Kukiela, from Python to C++

It uses the C++ Eigen library. Eigen can be obtained from https://eigen.tuxfamily.org


### Instructions

1. Includes just the C++ code. This can be made into a project by creating a new console app in VS and copying the files/code. For any other editor, refer to its documentation, please. 
2. This runs as a console app. The main file contains some ready-to-run models, just un-comment the code blocks as desired.
3. To load the Eigen lib in MS VS 2019 Project>Properties>Configuration Properties>VC++ Properties>Include Directories>[path to Eigen lib]
