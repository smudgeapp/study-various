# Simple Image Resize, Rotate and Split App

This is a very simple (and quite rough) image resize, rotate and split app. Just load the html file on any browser and it should work.

### Instructions/Reference

The entry point for the app is to load an image and resize it.

**Resize**

Image resize width and height have to be specified before loading the image, otherwise it will load the image as is.

**Rotate**

Once an image is loaded it can be rotated. Default setting is for 90 degrees clock-wise. 

The default setting can be modified by changing the script. In the html file look for the comment "ADJUST ROTATION PARAMETERS". 

**Split**

On the loaded image click on any point, now a start position has been designated. The second click on the image will designate the end position for the split and a rectangle will be automatically drawn.

Then click the 'Split Image' button to obtain the split portion separately.

**For image split to work click on the image in *diagonals*. For example, start click can be anywhere on the image, the second click should move away and down from the first click.**
