# CHEAT-O-METER

This app uses research on the relationship between facial features and likelihood of a person engaging in extradyadic relationships. It takes dimensions of the face through the camera and applies the findings of the research (*roughly*) to make assessment.

Also includes a questionnaire form of test on the subject.

It uses OpenCV343 library, haarcascade classifier to detect facial dimensions. OpenCV is not included and can be obtained from https://opencv.org/android/. Then just add the library to the project. OpenCV implementation code is included, but may have to be updated depending on the OpenCV version.

Wrote this a while back so much of the code is outdated, besides there are much better facial detection (and image detection in general) algorithms out there now.

For the rest of the code my feelings are best illustrated by this meme ![alt text](https://github.com/smudgeapp/study-various/cheatometer/meme.jpg?raw=true)
