# WORD2VEC Implementation in C++ (using components from the general neural network in this repo)

This is an implementation of the word2vec model in c++ using the basic components of the neural network, separately contained in this repo.

The data input and certain components were modified to fit the word2vec. 

This is just to gain better understanding of the underlying calculations of the model, therefore, there is no support for full corpus input and pre-processing.
