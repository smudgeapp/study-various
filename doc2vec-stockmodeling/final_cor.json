Deteriorating volumetric outlook for petroleum products and expected inventory losses and exchange losses were expected to stain the performance of the oil marketing segment in 1HFY19. PSO\u2019s profitability shows the same. PSO\u2019s revenues were moderately up by 10 percent, year-on-year, which was due to declining furnace oil sales volumes by 75 percent year-on-year in 1HFY19. This was accompanied by slow petrol and diesel sales and inventory losses due to declining oil prices. The industry sources highlight that the growth in PSO\u2019s top line was largely because of increasing lubricant and LPG sales. The sector has been experiencing other headwinds like the increasing circular debt, and shifting fuel mix, which has affected the market shares of the players in the sector. PSO that had an overall market share of 54 percent in the liquid fuel segment in 7MFY18 saw its share recede to 40 percent in 7MFY19. This was not only led by declining furnace oil market share from 73 percent to 45 percent, but also a decline in motor gasoline and diesel market shares; PSO\u2019s market share of MS came down from 41 percent to 36 percent, while HSD saw a decline from 46 percent to 38 percent in 7MFY19. The firm\u2019s net profit came down by over 50 percent, year-on-year in1HFY19, and besides weak volumes and inventory losses, PSO\u2019s decline in other income (penal income) and staggeringly high finance cost in the period were the key factors behind the dismal performance. PSO has been focusing on the retail side and its RLNG business. But the company\u2019s financial crunch due to the circular debt continues to overshadow all efforts to gain and retain market share. The company would really take a breather if the Rs200 billion circular debt clearance attempt by the government comes through soon.

Located on the coastal belt of Karachi, the main processing unit is located at Orange Creek with supporting crude berthing and storage facility at Kenmare. The initial design capacity of the refinery was to process 1 million tons of crude oil annually, which was subsequently expanded to 2.1 million tons per annum. Its current capacity stands at 47,000 barrels per day of crude oil into petroleum products like furnace oil, high speed diesel, kerosene oil, jet fuel and motor gasoline, among others. Before 2019, majority of PRL's shares were held primarily held by PSO, Shell and Hascol together hold over 70 percent of the shares. However, it FY19, Pakistan State Oil Company Limited (PSO) acquired 84 million shares from Shell Petroleum Company Limited, UK, which increased its shareholding in the Company to 52.68 percent, making PSO the parent company of PRL. The table gives the breakdown of the shareholding Refining sector's profitability has been on a roller coaster ride. PRL's profitability has too been up and down in the recent past. A look at the last five years show that PRL's earnings and margins dipped in the negative zone in FY14 as the refining margins for hydro-skimming refineries remained low due to sharp increase in crude oil prices and weak demand for products worldwide. \nThough profit margins improved for PRL in FY15, the fiscal year continued to drag the continued to affect the refining segment due to high cost and weak demand, which along with steep decline in crude oil and product prices resulted in heavy inventory losses. PRL saw a 36 percent year-on-year decrease in its top-line along with increased finance cost that resulted in after tax losses. This aggravated the negative equity situation of the firm, which had been an issue for the firm since 2010. \nFY15 was a year of up gradation and capex where the board of directors announced a right issue to meet the capex and financial requirements of its projects. It was in FY15 that PRL finally inaugurated its much awaited isomerisation plant that converts low-value naphtha into gasoline (petrol), a premium product, doubling its petrol production. The up gradation boded well on PRL's profitability and the company's earnings turned positive despite a decline in the revenues in FY16. Earnings became positive due to healthy gross refinery margins (GRMs) and the doubling of production of motor gasoline as the new isomerisation plant operated for full year. \nFollowing the right-issue and the firm's commissioning of the isomerisation plant, the liquidity position of the company improved as the bank borrowings reduced. In FY17, PRL saw its net profits improve by more than three times, which also brought some reduction to the negative equity. However, during the year, the refinery faced the deactivation of the catalyst of the isomerisation plant, which reduced the firm's petrol production from 20,000 metric tons to 15,000 metric tons. \nThe recovery that was seen after FY16 was busted in FY18 as PRL's profit after tax halved despite a healthy growth of 32 percent in the company's revenues. Refining margins remained weak and put pressure on gross profitability. \nAlso, the catalyst of isomerisation plant that was impaired FY17 could not be operated at full capacity from July to November 2017, which resulted in lower production of petrol by 22,000 metric tons. On the other hand, the company overcame the negative equity situation that it had been facing for long. \nFY18 was marred by increased exchange losses due to currency depreciation and pressure on refinery operation due to decline in furnace oil demand amid its curtailment, which resulted in buildup of stock pile for the refinery. The ill-fate for the refining segment continued in FY19 - rather worsened as coupled with slowing economy. The company highlights low prices of motor gasoline in the international markets, depressed refining margins and steep devaluation of the currency at home as key factors behind the debilitating in the company's financial performance. \nThe financial statement shows that PRL's revenue growth was around 25 percent, but the effect of weak refining margins can be seen in more that proportionate increase in cost of sales, resulting in gross loss for the period. \nDecline in furnace oil demand led to build-up of furnace oil inventory which in turn put pressure on the refinery operations. Consequently, the company incurred loss for the year amounting to Rs5.82 billion in FY19 as compared to profit of Rs504 million last year. \nPRL's liquidity position remained weak as can be seen from increase in short term borrowings due to increased working capital requirements as well as losses incurred by the refinery. And amid high interest rate environment, the company's finance cost jumped by 145 percent year-on-year in FY19. A key factor behind weak performance of the refining segment has been the sector's operations on age old technology and inability to up gradate. Time and again, refineries have been urged to speed up their expansion and up gradation projects as furnace oil curtailment continues and higher fuel standards await to be adopted along with high prospects for international competition. Upgrading to Euro II standards for diesel is still waiting to happen for the refineries whereas around the world, the refiners have moved onto Euro IV/V and are contemplating up gradation to Euro VI now. Along with other refineries, PRL too has been unable to complete the up gradation project of installation of Diesel Hydro-desulphurization Unit (DHDS) to produce EURO II compliant diesel. \nThis has been a key factor for poor performance of the refining sector. Though PRL's financial performance improved in 1QFY20, the turnaround of the firm will depend on expansion and up gradation. Growth in gross margins for PRL in 1QFY20 came from stable currency. \nPRL is still better off than other refineries, in that it has PSO's support to fulfill the up gradation projects. It has plans to invest $1 billion in converting its refining facility into a deep conversion refinery that convert furnace oil into petrol and high-speed diesel. This is the only way to go forward as the government has now warned the refineries to upgrade with significant progress in 3 months - or be ready for a shut down.

As highlighted many times in this space, the refining segment had a tough time in FY19 due to many factors like the decline in furnace oil demand that led to the build-up of inventory that had to be sold at lower prices resulting in lower margins. Refining margins also came under pressure as petrol price came down. Also the steep devaluation of currency against the Dollar was another factor for the weak profitability of the refining segment. PRL announced its 1QFY20 performance yesterday that showed a 40 percent year-on-year growth in the company's revenues, and hence a noticeable improvement in gross margins. Contained administrative and distribution expenses and increase in other income helped the refinery post operating profits in the period versus operating loss in 1QFY19. While PRL was able to post a PAT of Rs181 million in 1QFY20 versus a loss of Rs420 million in 1QFY19, its earnings were clipped by the rise in finance cost. Finance cost for PRL primarily consists of interest expense on borrowings -\u00a0 which increased for PRL due to increase in short term borrowings as well as increase in interest expense in a high interest rate environment - and exchange losses that had a huge share in FY19 due to the currency depreciation. During FY19 however, Pakistan State Oil Company Limited (PSO) acquired 84 million shares from Shell Petroleum Company Limited, UK, which increased its shareholding in the Company to 52.68 percent, making PSO the parent company of PRL. The management is hopeful that this relationship will help it overcome the challenges it has been facing. PRL's profitability has also been under constraint due to the delay incurred in the refinery upgradation process. Under the policy framework for up-gradation and expansion of refinery projects issued by the Ministry of Energy (MoE) in 2013, refineries were required to install Diesel Hydrodesulphurisation Unit (DHDS) by June 30, 2017 to produce EURO II compliant High Speed Diesel (HSD) and in case of non-compliance, the ex-refinery price of HSD based on Import Parity Pricing (IPP) formula would be brought down due to higher sulphur content. The Company did not meet the said deadline, which has been a reason for the losses incurred by the company. However, as per its FY19 Annual report, the Body has approved the upgrade project and work is underway.

In 2014, HASCOL was listed on Pakistan Stock Exchange Limited. \nIn a very short time- just a decade HASCOL achieved the status of largest OMC after PSO in terms of storage. HASCOL has a strategic license agreement with FUCHS Middle East (FOMEL), an associate of FUCHS Petrolub based in Germany, to represent the brand in Pakistan. \nIt also markets LPG through its retail network for the automotive sector, and currently there are 15 AutoMax LPG stations across Pakistan in various stages of approval with the government. \nHASCOL and Vitol, one of its key shareholders have also entered into a joint venture company for marketing of LNG in the country with 30/70 percent share, respectively. \nHASCOL has also signed a Technical Services Agreement with Vitol Aviation to enable the firm to start fuelling aircrafts at Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad airports in the country. \nAs per the latest annual report for HASCOL, the company's major shareholders include Mr. Mumtaz Hasan Khan, the chairman and director at HASCOL with over 18 percent shareholding; Marshal Gas (Pvt) Limited with over 6 percent shareholding, Fossil Energy (Pvt) Limited with shareholding of around 11 percent. \nAlso among the foreign companies is the key shareholder, Vitol a global oil trader with a share of around 27.5 percent, which is slated to go up as there is likelihood that this global company might be increasing its shareholding in the company. \nRecall that in November 2015, the global oil trader, Vitol acquired 15 percent of HASCOL and another 10 percent in 2016, which made Vitol Dubai Limited the largest shareholder in the company. \nHASCOL's financial performance over the last five to six years has gone from good to worse. In earlier part of these years, HASCOL's performance as an oil marketing company has been on point as company capitalised on the booming POL demand in the country and hence higher retail fuel sales like petrol and diesel. \nAt the same time, the company in collaboration with its international sponsor Vitol added 232,000 cubic metres of oil storage capacity at Port Qasim, taking its storage to 28 days from 16 days previously. Volumes at HASCOL grew with a CAGR of 54 percent over 2011-16. As of March 31, 2019, the company had 571 retail outlets in Pakistan according to the company's website with concentration in Punjab and Sindh. 2016 and 2017 were good years for HASCOL as operational performance improved with growth in volumes and net margins. \nKey highlights for 2016 included the commissioning of ZY terminal at Keamari that enabled the company to import larger volumes of motor gasoline; and the completion of a storage facility at Mehmood Kot that enabled the firm to receive diesel directly via pipeline from Karachi. The company also set up Hascol Terminals Limited with Vitol for 200,000 metric tons of storage at Port Qasim. In 2017, HASCOL also started a chemical business for importing bulk chemicals and supplying to end users. The same year, HASCOL also announced right issue of 20 percent to fund upcoming projects like development of storage facilities, retail outlets and lube oil and grease blending plant. While the company's revenues grew, volumes started to whither in 2018; growth in revenues came from higher prices of retail fuels and not growth in volumes. This decline in volumes for the company came as a general downtrend in the consumption patterns in the country as well as increasing competition. \nHigher margins earned on retail fuels resulted in growth in gross profit but the oil and gas downstream sector was bitten by high exchange losses due to rapid currency depreciation. As a result, the company's earnings fell primarily due to exchange losses and also due to increased borrowings for capex as well as working capital needs. \nDuring 2019 so far, HASCOL completed its Lube Oil Blending Plant where Fuchs Middle East will have a 50 percent equity position in the facility, which is likely to help the company in invigorating its lubricants sales with a positive impact on the profitability. However, the profitability in 2019 so far has been depressing. \nThe company in 9MCY19 posted loss after tax versus profit in similar period last year. \nThe first two quarters of the year have been brutal in terms of not only volumetric growth but also exchange losses that the company faced. The exchange losses eased in 3QCY19 but the volumetric slide continued and the damage from the exchange losses from 1HCY19 was too large to be offset in overall 9MCY19. \nWhat affected the earnings in 9MCY19 further was over Rs6 billion in other expenses versus none in similar period, which was due to loss incurred due to fluctuation in the international oil prices, market volatility and local economic conditions coupled with massive devaluation of Pakistani Rupee causing an increase in product cost as per the notes to the quarterly accounts. \nOn the volumetric side, HASCOL's sales revenue also continued to decline as volumes fell from 646,000 in 3QCY18 to 210,000 metric tons in 3QCY19 due to the shortage of working capital to procure the product, which also shot up the finance cost for the OMC. \nAlso, Hascol Petroleum Limited has faced a significant decline in market share from around 13-14 percent for Jul-Sep 2018 to only 5 percent for Jul-Sep 2019 as all its reliance is on the import of petroleum products and has very minor allocation of local refineries. \nAny development on the issue of exchange volatility for the OMCs taken up by the government will bring the much needed respite the downstream oil and has sector is looking for. Also, the company is hopeful to turn things around soon by moving procurement largely to local refineries to reduce reliance on import and hence the volatility in exchange rate movement. \nThe company is also considering issuing right shares and recently announced that it will issue rights at 10 rupees in a bid to raise Rs8 billion. It is most likely that Vitol will increase its shareholding through this right issue.

Based on PakWheels' research-based documents, the movers and shakers of Pakistan's automobile industry make important policy decisions. Keeping in line with its tradition of being at the forefront of Pakistan's automobile scene, PakWheels this year too, conducted a detailed survey titled\u00a0Automobile Industry Survey Report 2018. Automobile Industry Survey Report 2018 had the survey pool of 35,176, representing all the four provinces and the federal territory. Both men and women were part of the survey sample. Like its predecessors, Automobile Industry Survey Report 2018 has been divided into two main parts - car owners/drivers and motorcycle riders. They were asked the same set of questions regarding their buying preferences, opinions regarding their vehicles, their preferred automobile brands and the factors that were important to them while buying a car/motorcycle, etc. In the car segment, it is Toyota which dominates the market (35%), followed by Suzuki (29%) and Honda (27%). Under Toyota's brand, Corolla emerged as the clear winner with a 20% market share, followed by Honda City (12%) and Civic (11%). Under Suzuki's banner,   (2%) were the most popular models among survey respondents. The pattern that emerges from the survey is rather interesting - that while Honda and Suzuki have more than one popular models, Toyota has only one - Corolla. Interestingly, this consumer behavior hasn't changed much since last year. According to the\u00a0Automobile Industry Survey Report 2017,\u00a035% of the local market was dominated by Toyota, followed by Suzuki at 28%, and 27% Honda, while 11% of the car market was dominated by other automobile brands. Moving to the motorcycle segment of the survey, Honda ruled the roost. 59% of the bike segment was dominated by Honda, followed by Yamaha at 8%. Under the Honda brand, the most popular models are   is the most popular Suzuki bike, which dominated 3% of the bike market. Under the Yamaha brand,   and YBR 125 G were the most popular models, which equally (2%) dominated the bike market. As per the latest survey, 76% of the respondents spent less than 2 million when buying a car. The biggest chunk of the respondents (50%) in this category spent anywhere from 0.5 million to 1.5 million when buying their cars. Only 3% spent more than 3.5 million on their cars. In the motorcycle category, 76% of the respondents reported spending less than 100,000 rupees when buying a motorcycle. This percentage can be further broken down into 34% of respondents spending less than 50,000 rupees and 42% spending up to 100,000 when buying a bike. Like its predecessors, this survey, too, revealed some interesting facts. For example, while 80% had a driving license, 20% drove or rode without a license. An alarming number of 67% of respondents aged less than 18 drove without a driver\u2019s license. 64 % of the respondents bought a used car, while 34% bought a new car. 9% of the used cars were bought through car financing, while 34% of new cars were bought through car financing. 70% of the respondents reported owning a locally manufactured car, while 28% of the respondents owned an imported car. The most important aspect for respondents owning cars was their vehicle's safety, followed by comfort and then fuel efficiency. Interestingly, their car's resale value played a minor role in their decision of buying that car. Switching to the motorcycle/bike segment,\u00a062% of the respondents owned a new bike, while 35% owned a used bike. 89% of the respondents reported owning a locally manufactured bike, while 5% of the respondents owned an imported bike. The most important aspect for respondents owning bikes was their vehicle's fuel efficiency, followed by safety and comfort. Interestingly, their bike's resale value played a minor role in their decision-making process.

Smoking was cause of many life threatening diseases like cancer and ailments of lungs and mouth. The cancer patients had to go through painful medical treatment on which millions of rupees were spent.

Part of this has to do with change in the energy mix that has affected both refineries and oil marketing companies; their revenues have shifted away from the furnace oil that once made the single largest contribution. LNG has been replacing FO in the power sector and retail fuels like diesel and petrol growth that took off in FY13 has also slowed down. In the same vein, Pakistan State Oil (PSX: PSO), the largest player in the industry has too seen its black oil market shrinking, and white oil market growth consolidating. PSO is the country\u2019s largest OMC and is engaged in marketing and distribution of all petroleum products: Motor Gasoline (Mogas), High Speed Diesel (HSD), Furnace Oil (FO), Jet Fuel (JP-1), Kerosene, CNG, LPG, Petrochemicals and Lubricants. The leader of the downstream oil and gas sector also imports products like Mogas, HSD JP-1 and FO based on the demand. With 3500 plus outlets across Pakistan, PSO also has the largest distribution network through which it serves both retail and bulk customers. It also has the largest storage capacity in the country, which is approximately a million metric tons, representing 68 percent of the total storage capacity owned by all the OMCs. Government of Pakistan holds the highest shareholding making up 22.47 percent shares of PSO, according to the latest pattern of shareholding; NBP Trustee Department has 14.88 percent shareholding. The firm has strategic investments including 12 percent in Parco\u2019s White Oil Pipeline Project; 53 percent in PRL, which was increased in FY19 from the previous 22.5 percent; 22 percent in Pak Grease Manufacturing Company Limited; 49 percent in Asia Petroleum Limited; 62 percent investment in Joint Installation of Marketing Companies, and 50 percent in new Islamabad airport fuel farm as per the company\u2019s FY19 annual report. FY17 was a better year for PSO as it witnessed a growth of 8 percent on a year-on-year basis, compared to a growth ranging between -9 percent to 4 percent in the previous six fiscal years. Rise in volumes along with higher prices and the RLNG business led to 30 percent year-on-year surge in the PSO\u2019s sales revenues and 77 percent growth in the bottom-line. Other factor that lifted the bottomline was the reduction in the finance cost. PSO\u2019s volumetric growth continued in FY18 in white oil segment, especially motor spirit and HSD even though the retail segment faced stiff competition from new entrants, and substantial discounts offered by competitors and the influx of smuggled products like diesel from Iran. However, PSO\u2019s fuel oil volume declined by 29.6 percent year-on-year in FY18. owing to industry dynamics. i.e. government\u2019s strategy of switching priority (merit order) of existing power plants to RLNG/natural gas from furnace oil. The company\u2019s net revenues increased by 20 percent, year-on-year, while profit after tax went down by 15.2 percent year-on-year primarily on account of one-time reversal of deferred tax asset; decrease in other income by 32.7 percent year-on-year; and increase in other expenses by over 40 percent due to higher exchange losses on account of significant currency depreciation. FY19 was a challenging year for the oil marketing segment due to the rising competition and economic contraction. While competition increased, margins also squeezed due to falling liquid fuel volumes by the sector. The decline continued for furnace oil due to curtailment drive in the country, while the retail fuels especially diesel volumes also witnessed a decline due to falling demand from both the industrial sector, and the transport sector along with falling vehicle sales. Moreover, the high interest rate environment along with exchange losses, peaking circular debt and mounting receivables were key factors that dragged the sectors performance including that of PSO. PSO posted a year-on-year increase of 9 percent in its net revenues in FY19. Despite an overall decline of around 38 percent year-on-year in volumetric sales, PSO\u2019s revenues posted modest increase versus a decline by most of the other oil marketing companies. This was due to a rebound in the the company\u2019s volumes in the last quarter of FY19. the company\u2019s earnigns slipped by 32 percent, which came from higher inventory losses as well as lower volumes. Plus lower other income and higher other expenses\u00a0 and finance cost weighed heavy on its proftability due to exchange losses from currency depreciation and high interst expense on borrowings. PSO\u2019s consolidated accounts for FY19 showed that other income grew staggeringly by over two times likely because of gains on the acquisition and consolidation of PRL after PSO acquired 52.67 percent stake in the refinery during the year. 9MFY20 for theOMC sector was wounded by the  oronavirus outbreak and the resulting lockdown as consumption of petroleum products took a road downhill. However, as perr the company\u2019s quarterly report PSO was able to regain lost market share with an increase of 2.4 percent in motor gasoline to stand at 38.8 percent, and 5.8 percent in diesel to stand at 43.4 percent in 9MFY20. Its overall market share in white oil stood at 42.9 percent versus 39.2 pecent in 9MFY19. However, the company\u2019s profitability was marred by crashing oil prices in March 2020, stagnant demand due to slowing economy as well as the COVID-19 outbreak and the resultant lockdown. Earnings for 9MFY20 declined by almost half , while the 3QFY20 witnessed loss after tax or Rs3.4 bilion versus profit of Rs1.67 billion in 9MFY19. Significant inventory losses was a key factor due to prices crash in the crude oil market ,which also resulted in price decline for the petroleum products like motor spirit and high speed diesel. Higher operating costs and high finance cost in 3QFY20 also ate away the margins.\u00a0 Growth in finance cost is a constant battle for PSO due to mounting circular debt and resulting increase in short term borrowings, while exchange losses also impacted earnings in the latest quarter. Loss incurred in 3QFY20 affected the overall profitability of PSO. COVID-19 has destroyed demand for petroelum products. PSO was already facing liquidity crunch which has worsened after the pandemic.However, the company can pin hopes to two recent events: one, the lockdown has been eased, which will bring back some demand in the last quarter of FY20; second, the govenrment has finally issued Sukuk II, which would bring some respite to the company\u2019s liquidity miseries. Earlier in April, the ECC also approved the immediate release of Rs29.7 billion in respect of exchange loss recievable by PSO on foreign currency loans taken. It also instructed immediate release of Rs60 billion by Power Division in favour of PSO. All these factors along with decline in interest rates are hoped to lift FY20 earning for PSO.

The firm has strategic investments including 12 percent in Pak Arab Pipeline Company, which is an associate company; 63.3 percent in Pakistan Refinery Limited; which is a subsidiary company; 22 percent in Pak Grease Manufacturing Company Limited; 49 percent in Asia Petroleum Limited, which is an associate company; 62 percent investment in Joint Installation of Marketing Companies,44 percent  in Eastern Joint Hydrant and 50 percent in new Islamabad airport fuel farm as per the company\u2019s FY20 annual report. A breakup of the shareholding pattern in shown in in the illustration.  Compared to a growth ranging between -9 percent to 4 percent in the previous six fiscal years, FY17 was a better year for PSO as it witnessed a growth of 8 percent in sales volumes on a year-on-year basis. Rising volumes as well as prices and the RLNG business led to 30 percent year-on-year surge in the PSO\u2019s sales revenues and 77 percent growth in the bottom-line.  PSO\u2019s volumetric growth continued in FY18 in white oil segment, especially motor spirit and HSD even though the retail segment faced stiff competition from new entrants, and substantial discounts offered by competitors and the influx of smuggled products like diesel from Iran. However, in black oil segment PSO\u2019s furnace oil volume declined by 29.6 percent year-on-year in FY18 due to government\u2019s strategy of switching priority (merit order) of existing power plants to RLNG/natural gas from furnace oil. The company\u2019s net revenues increased by 20 percent, year-on-year, while profit after tax went down by 15.2 percent year-on-year primarily on account of one-time reversal of deferred tax asset; decrease in other income by 32.7 percent year-on-year; and increase in other expenses by over 40 percent due to higher exchange losses on account of significant currency depreciation. FY19 was a difficult year for the oil marketing segment due to the rising competition and economic downturn. Margins on products squeezed due to falling liquid fuel volumes by the sector. The decline continued for furnace oil, while the retail fuels especially diesel volumes also witnessed a decline due to falling demand from both the industrial sector, and the transport sector along with falling vehicle sales.  PSO\u2019s revenues in FY19 increased by 9 percent, which was fairly satisfactory given an overall decline of around 38 percent year-on-year in volumetric sales as well as falling revenues of other OMCs. The company\u2019s earnings however,  slipped by 32 percent, which came from higher inventory losses as well as lower volumes. Plus lower other income and higher other expenses  and finance cost weighed heavy on its profitability due to exchange losses from currency depreciation and high interest expense on borrowings. PSO\u2019s consolidated accounts for FY19 showed that other income grew staggeringly by over two times because of gains on the acquisition and consolidation of PRL after PSO acquired stake in the refinery during the year. FY20 was a painful year mostly because COVID-19 aggravated the decline in the volumes being sold by the downstream oil and gas sector. In addition to the petrol crisis that took place during the year, coronavirus outbreak and the resulting lockdown hit the consumption of petroleum products hard. The decline in volumes for the oil marketing companies that were already facing falling sales due to economic slowdown, mutiplied. PSO reported hefty losses after tax for the FY20 where the company\u2019s loss after tax stood at Rs6.5 billion in FY20 against PAT of Rs10.6 billion in FY19. Asper the brokerage industry, out of the total expected inventory losses of around Rs20 billion that Pakistan State Oil Limited incurred in FY20, almost all if it was incurred in the 2HFY20 with the situation worse in 4QFY20.  Segment wise, the petroleum sector suffered alossin FY20 versus profits of FY19 again due to inventory losses incurred from the decrease in oil prices in international oil market. Also, the company also incurred a loss in the LNG segment in FY20 versus profits of FY19 due to increase in finance cost on financing higher receivables from SNGPL.  Apart from staggeringly high inventory losses in FY20, PSO\u2019s decline in earnings was also facilitated by the decline in the company\u2019s topline. Revenues for PSO slipped by 4 percent year-on-year during the year due to fall in volumes sold as well as the crude oil price crash. The company\u2019s overall volumes fell by around 10 percent, and the decline was led by furnace oil sales that plunged by around 50 percent year-on-year. Also higher finance cost by almost 50 percent was a burden on the bottomline.  PSO had a breather in 1QFY21 after a difficult FY20. The oil marketing company returned to profits in the first quarter of FY21 after incurring a loss in the last quarter of 4QFY20.  During 1QFY21, PSO witnessed a rebound in volumes with growth of 11.8 percent in motor gasoline, 17.1 percent in high speed diesel, and over 37 percent in black oil that also includes furnace oil.  The company\u2019s revenues however slipped by one percent year-on-year due to decline in selling price of petroleum products during the quarter versus similar period of FY20. Decline in cost of sales at the same time however lifted gross profits with margins due to inventory gains. Moreover, distribution expenses remained flat while administrative expenses posted modest growth . However, the OMC\u2019s other income declined by 23 percent, which was likely due to lower markup on delayed payments. But the respite from finance cost helped in the bottomline growth. PSO\u2019s earnings for 1QFY21 increased by 46 percent. Demand destruction from COVID-19 has aggravated PSO\u2019s liquidity crunch. However, volumetric recovery in FY21 offers hope on the sales side. PSO has also launched Euro 5 Hi-Octane 97 and Altron Premium Euro 5 (92 Ron) during the months of August and September 2020; whereas plans for the launch of Euro 5 compliant HSD are also underway.

According to details, PSO regularly conducts spot tenders for supply of motor gasoline and seasonal furnace oil cargoes which are supplied by a small group of globally influential international oil suppliers such as Gunvor, Enoc, Vitol, Petro China, OTI, BB Energy represented by highly powerful local indenting agents. \"The current PSO tendering process is designed in a fair way to encourage open participation from serious suppliers\", sources said and added that there is a bid bond of $300,000 for participation. Subsequently winners of the tender are to place a 10 percent performance guarantee of the value of the cargo which PSO can cash upon their failure. Payment is by 30 days or 60 days LC and there are very heavy late delivery penalties of $1/mt/day. These terms are highly stringent, tough and considered very risky for suppliers compared to any international oil trading terms including widely used Shell's and BP's standard terms and conditions, sources said. \"For years this has meant that PSO and as a result Pakistan's oil supply has been controlled by a small and highly profitable group of oil companies that continuously make profits whether oil prices go up or down,\" they added. Furthermore, these companies through their indenting agents and various lobbies had monopolised the Pakistan market by creating a \"Euro II Pakistan spec\" motor gasoline that is only used in Pakistan, sources said. While developing a network of supply, storage and shipping that created huge barriers of entry for new international oil trading companies to enter the Pakistan market and successfully capturing a high price premium (the premium is the cost of freight and suppliers margin on top of the daily market index of refined product prices such as Mean of Platts Arabian Gulf (MOPAG)), they said. \"Some of these companies have invested in our local private oil marketing companies, which was described as a great indicator of success for our oil industry,\" they said. However, one only needs to look at how Hascol Petroleum's local network has been 'abused' to be flooded and dumped with oil when it is in the benefit of these suppliers and completely dried up when oil was at an all-time low and cheap oil could benefit Pakistan, they added. The strength of this mafia was witnessed most recently when there was a huge hue and cry and an attempt to create panic when the PTI government announced Pakistan's switch to Euro V grade motor gasoline in August 2020, sources said. \"In order to maintain the monopoly and advantage on the spec these suppliers created widespread fear and panic in the industry through claims such as the Euro V spec isn't available in the Middle East Region, they claimed that improved spec would be more costly, and new specialised infrastructure including storages, ships would be required to handle the Euro V spec creating the fear of an oil shortage or as they prefer to call it an oil crisis,\" they added.  \"PTI Government stuck to its belief that Euro V being a more widely traded and environmentally friendly spec would result in benefit to the country, ordering PSO to tender for the new Euro V spec. As expected this same oil mafia participated in the tender and quoted all time high price premiums of $4.0-4.5/bbl. Where as the price premiums for Euro II Pakistan Specs were in the range of $3.5/bbl. \"However, 2 new UAE-based suppliers Max Energy and 1 Energin intervened and crashed the well-crafted plan of this oil mafia by being the lowest 2 bidders. These companies quoted prices in the range of $2.5-3.0/bbl which were even less than the price of the previous 'Euro II Pakistan' spec. Taken completely by surprise the existing suppliers and their local indenting agents resorted to discrediting these new suppliers claiming that they would not perform and that these are not real genuine suppliers and non performance from these new suppliers would lead to another oil crisis,\" sources said. \"Although they had tendered for multiple cargoes, PSO succumbed to the pressure created by this lobby and only awarded Max Energy the first cargo while not awarding 1 Energin the second cargo hoping this would discourage the new entrant. However, in the subsequent tender 1 Energin bid the best number and left PSO with no choice but to award the contract,\" they said. \"What followed was a textbook display of dirty tactics, intimidation, blackmail, and fear in which the subject oil companies used every card in the playbook to prevent these new entrants from performing on their contract with PSO and incurring losses that would drive them away from the market. They blocked supply lines, banking channels, drove up the prices of all the available ships. And of course exhausted all efforts to discredit these new companies in PSO and the Pakistan market by claiming these companies are 'front companies' supplying stolen and smuggled oil. A quick check will show that the reality is very different and that like in any industry these smaller companies not only compete but also regularly collaborate with the same large international oil suppliers in sourcing, shipping, storage and trading\". Sources said the incumbent players were accusing these new companies of supplying 'smuggled' and 'stolen' oil. \"After being blocked, delayed and blackmailed in the freight market 1 Energin had at double the market freight rates chartered a vessel MT Lia to deliver the Euro V Motor Gasoline cargo to PSO. The vessel MT Lia is owned and operated by none other than Clearlake Shipping which is 'a wholly owned Gunvor entity' as per the oil trading giants website. Similarly Max Energy also faced the same tactics, discrediting and blackmail from the wounded giants. However, both companies after some delays were able to successfully perform delivery of the cargoes fulfilling the quantity and quality requirements of PSO. These new suppliers successfully broke the longstanding monopoly of the existing oil mafia which hasn't seen a new entrant in years. And against all odds saved Pakistan from the obvious price manipulation that was planned by the incumbent suppliers. Recent tender results show that the same suppliers that initially bid above the $4.0/bbl levels have come down to the $3.0/bbl levels to compete with the new suppliers,\" sources alleged. \"These new suppliers instead of being encouraged and supported by PSO have instead as per the terms and conditions of their contract been penalised by PSO to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars as late delivery penalties. Although much more than any profits on their cargoes they have honoured the terms of the contracts and paid the penalties in full, taking a long term business view. Justifying them as a cost of entry into a new market believing that they will get a fair chance as per the PSO tender process to successfully compete and capture a share in the growing Pakistan market,\" they added. \"In a clear attempt to favour the incumbents and take out these 2 new suppliers from the picture PSO for the first time in their history instead of tendering for parcel sizes of 55,000 MT called for a tender of 100,000 MT cargo size to be delivered in 18-31 Oct, claiming that the larger parcel size would optimise economies of scale and bring about a decrease in premiums. However, it was clear that the hope was that by raising the stakes, the recently penalised new suppliers would be deterred by the increase in the bid bond, performance guarantee and potential late penalties. However, the spirit of free market and open competition prevailed and a new Singapore supplier named Epdesa entered the market and bid a premium of $3.80/bbl beating out the incumbents who once again bid above the $4.0/bbl levels. This time PSO would have had to award the full 100,000 MT cargo to the new supplier Epdesa, however, PSO once again gave in to the pressures of the monopoly and decided to scrap this tender as they claimed the premium was too high,\" they added. \"Subsequently, PSO returned to its previous model of tendering for 55,000 MT cargoes. After delivering their first cargoes, these small suppliers have continued to participate and won and delivered successfully two further cargoes this time without any delays or problems. However, PSO succumbed to the lobbying and pressures of the oil mafia and on 19 October 2020 announced that they would do a pre-qualification for suppliers of POL products to assess the capability and capacity of suppliers. After 19 December only 'pre-qualified suppliers' will be able to bid and participate in PSO tenders. A closer look at the requirements and scoring of the pre-qualification shows that it is designed specifically to eliminate the same new suppliers and qualify the international giants that have monopolised and take advantage of Pakistan's supplies. This show that instead of encouraging open competition and analytically looking at the benefits of PTI Government's decision to introduce a cleaner, better and widely traded fuel. PSO has given in once again to the fear mongering of an oil crisis that is always looming large and strengthened the monopoly of the mafia that always has and will inevitability take advantage of our country,\" sources said.

PSO would like to elucidate the following. \u201cPSO firmly believes in transparent business practices and upholds the highest standards of business ethics in all its dealings and practices. As the national oil marketing company, PSO\u2019s foremost responsibility is ensuring an uninterrupted supply of fuel across the country.  \u201cPSO strictly follows the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) rules and guidelines for all its tendering processes to ensure competitive bidding procedures and provides a level playing field to all suppliers. Furthermore, PSO\u2019s tendering process has been scrutinized by the Supreme Court during sou-moto proceedings wherein the Supreme Court appointed auditor KPMG submitted a detailed report endorsing the transparency of the process and no irregularity or non-compliance was found. \u201cIn accordance with the recent PPRA rule 16-A allowing fuel procurement through framework agreement under the pre-qualification process, PSO has initiated the prequalification process which significantly reduces the overall ordering time thus allowing the Company to cater to demand-supply fluctuations and meet the nation\u2019s fuel demand more efficiently while taking full advantage of the e-procurement facility recently allowed by PPRA. The shorter procurement cycle may also reduce PSO's exposure to demurrages which will not only benefit the company but also the national exchequer in terms of forex outflows. Furthermore, the prequalification process strengthens the due diligence process of the Company for its petroleum international vendors/suppliers particularly with regards to their standing in the international market, experience, operational and financial capability and legal history so as to ensure that PSO does business with suppliers that can deliver quality products in a timely manner while ensuring compliance with international trade laws, rules and restrictions. Additionally, suppliers fulfilling the criteria and requirements of the prequalification may enter the panel of suppliers at any point in time throughout the validity period of the prequalification. Therefore, the prequalification process would not restrict participation of parties but ensure that the Company\u2019s interests are secured. \u201cIn PSO's open competitive bidding process, tenders are floated through advertisements which are published on PSO and PPRA websites along with renowned newspapers. International suppliers have to participate in the tenders directly, there is no active role of local agents in the bidding process as incorrectly mentioned in the story. Around 12-15 international suppliers actively participate and compete in PSO\u2019s POL tenders who can effectively compete with the entire POL supplier base doing business in Pakistan. Hence, it is incorrect to refer to them as a small group. The story is self-contradictory, as in the second paragraph, the story says that \"current PSO tendering process is designed in a fair way to encourage open participation from serious suppliers\". Bid Bond and Performance Guarantee provisions are kept in PSO's tenders strictly in accordance with PPRA rules. \u201cThe penalties for delay in delivery of cargoes are in line with the PPRA rules and as per the terms and conditions of governing contracts. These terms have been kept keeping in view the fragile petroleum products supply chain of the country. Any inordinate delays in the arrival of PSO's cargoes can make the country's overall supply chain vulnerable as PSO, being the national oil company and the largest OMC, having around 45 percent of the market share is bound to supply products in the market to keep the nation\u2019s wheels running and fuel shortages can put the entire economy of the country under pressure. With regards to penalties imposed on M/s 1Energin, the cargo supplied by them arrived after an inordinate delay of two weeks from the contractual delivery date and PSO had to make a tremendous effort to avoid a dry out situation. The penalties imposed were strictly as per the terms and conditions of the contract. \u201cThe specifications of products to be imported in Pakistan are regulated by the Government of Pakistan (GOP) through Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division) which are uniform for the entire industry and have to be complied with. Moreover, in line with the international developments, GOP has already changed the specifications to Euro V grade. It is also worth mentioning that PSO fully supported GOP\u2019s initiative to change the specifications to Euro V and became the first oil marketing company to introduce Euro V fuel in Pakistan despite resistance from various quarters including local refineries and few other oil marketing companies. \u201cPSO awards cargoes as per the demand / supply situation in the country. Due to the 30-day international tendering period as per PPRA rules and the potential demand / supply fluctuation and local refineries production vulnerability during this 30 day period, PSO floats tender for the requirement keeping in view the best case demand scenario and awards cargoes as per actual requirement after tender opening on the basis of lowest bid value. This is a routine practice and cargoes are always awarded by PSO after thorough review of the demand / supply situation and multiple level approvals within the organization irrespective of who is the supplier. Therefore it is incorrect to assume that PSO did not award cargo to any supplier to discourage them from participating in the tenders.  This can also be validated from the fact that referred tender was awarded to one of the new suppliers M/s Max Energy and referred supplier M/s 1Energin was also awarded the cargo from subsequent tender when there was the need to buy that cargo. \"In order to achieve economies of scale and pass on the benefit to the end user a 100,000 MT volume based tender was launched instead of 50,000 MT cargo based tender as a litmus test in parallel to normal tenders with the aim of getting lower premiums for higher committed volumes. However, the quotes received in the said tender were not in line with the perceived benefit of low premium due to large quantity therefore no cargo was awarded from that tender and PSO continued with its usual cargo size tendering process of cargo based bidding and is awarding all its tenders accordingly.\u201d Being a responsible corporate entity, PSO complies with all the rules and regulations of corporate governance and believes in transparency in all its business dealings and practices.

Accordingly, the oil industry is being affected badly and a glut has emerged due to reduction in country-wide demand for petroleum products. \nPSO's liquidity position was already critical due to long outstanding receivables from the power sector, PIA, Ministry of Finance and SNGPL which have accumulated to Rs 370.9 billion. \nHowever, due to the pandemic, PSO's daily cash collection from its white oil business has drastically reduced by more than 55 per cent resulting in a severe liquidity crunch. Sale of RFO had already been minimized because of the shift of power sector to alternate fuel. Therefore, PSO has already gone past payment due dates on local refineries and is also on the verge of default on various international payments. \nThe critical liquidity position of PSO can trigger a potential fuel crisis in the country.

However, Genco-III did not release any payment to PSO and invested Rs 32 billion in Nandipur while Rs 19 billion had been retained on account of operational losses incurred by Genco-III. \nPresently, PSO is facing severe cash flow constraints due to Covid-19 pandemic and requires Rs 81.3 billion up to April 30, 2020 to retire international L/Cs to the suppliers of POL products and LNG. \nThe details are as follows: LNG( QG) Rs 4.9 billion (March 31-April 20); (ii) Mogas, Rs 4.5(April 1-April 20); (iii) HSD(KPC), Rs 3.6 billion (April 6- April 20; (iv) LNG( QG) Rs 4.9 billion( April 6-April 20); (v) LNG(QG) Rs 4.9( April 9-April 20); (vi) Mogas, Rs 3.4 billion( April 10- April 20) and; (vii) various Rs 55.1 billion (April 11-April 30). \nThe Petroleum Division maintains that to strengthen PSO's liquidity position and to maintain a smooth supply chain of petroleum products in the country, it has repeatedly sought the release of significant payment to PSO but to no avail. However, in case of default on international payments, it will be the shared responsibility of all relevant Ministries/Divisions/organizations. \nIn order to avoid international default and to avert the impending energy supply chain crisis in the country, the following steps have been proposed: (i) though ECC has directed Finance Division to consider allocation of requisite amount, in favour of PSO from next financial year, however, keeping in view the current financial constraints of PSO and to avoid any fuel shortages in the country, Rs 29.7 billion may be released to PSO immediately by Ministry of Finance on account of exchange losses incurred by PSO on FE-25 loans booked on the instructions of Ministry of Finance. This is already approved by the ECC; (ii) subsidy for fertilizer and export sectors totaling Rs 14 billion may be released immediately; (iii) at least Rs 60 billion may immediately be arranged for PSO by Power Division and; (iv) PIA may also be directed to release at least Rs 5 billion out of Rs 19.5 billion immediately.

With cost of sales having around 97 percent share in revenues, changes at the top are profound for the OMC giants. In the period under consideration, likely decrease in inventory losses versus a weaker 2QFY20 in terms of staggeringly high inventory losses has overall been key in lifting the company\u2019s earnings. Moreover, PSO has been seen regaining lost market share in recent months and growth in volumes, which has also contributed to the company\u2019s topline. In 1HFY20, PSO\u2019s overall market share increased by 4.8 percent, while its overall liquid volumes also increased by 4.4 percent versus a negative growth of 6.5 percent of the industry. What also supported PSO\u2019s bottomline was the growth in other income constituting mostly of penal income or late payment surcharge, which helped PSO absorb the jump in finance cost. At the same time, PSO also benefitted from exchange gains in 1HFY20 where the currency appreciated by 1 percent, versus exchange losses in the previous period. Finance cost for PSO continued to climb on the back of rising receivables amid growing circular debt levels. While receivables from the power sector took a breather in 1HFY20 as per the company, receivables from SNGPL continued to soar. While the macroeconomic headwinds are expected to remain in place, PSO\u2019s earning expectations are upbeat due to no hefty exchange losses in the offing and chances of the second tranche of circular debt clearance that would ease liquidity. That could follow a dividend announcement as the company did not announce one for 1HFY20 despite the growth in earnings, which brought the stock price under pressure.

Cynics or skeptics believe that nothing is going to happen except some fine and any meaningful step may not be taken. The fact of the matter is that KE has delayed many actions and projects which cannot be rectified quickly .There is a problem of under-capacity and under-utilization of existing capacities. KE has been on profit maximization strategy for a long time now, \"ignoring\" its contractual and legal obligations, which tantamount to killing the goose that lays golden eggs.  NEPRA has issued a show-cause notice with the following list of charges, which except for a few issues, are correct and legitimate. The following is the list: the Licensee (KE) has failed to ensure availability of stock of 120,000 M. tons at BPQS-I despite having storage capacity; Hourly generation data examined at BQPS-I revealed that BQPS-I was underutilized as it could only generate 916MW as against a dependable capacity of 1107 MW; lack of proper maintenance of machines despite routine maintenance expenses allowed by the Authority to the tune of Rs.25.07 billion in multiyear tariff;  with proper maintenance it could have generated approximately 250 MW additional power from its own generation facilities; a new power plant of 900 MW BPQS-III which was to come online by December 2019 ; NEPRA allowed US$ 730.51 million or Rs.84, 408.6 million as total cost for BPQS-III and allied projects in multiyear tariff determination dated 09-10-20 17 of the Licensee. Despite the fact that cost of the said project has been allowed in 2017 and passed on to the consumers, KE has failed to complete the said project to fulfill its obligation to make adequate investment in generation segment to meet load demand; KE has not executed Gas Supply Agreement (GSA) with Sui Southern Gas Company Limited (SSGCL) to ensure reliable supply of gas for its generating facilities despite clear direction of the Authority; Fuel Supply Agreement (FSA) between the Licensee and Pakistan State Oil Company Limited (PSO) requires the Licensee(KE) to place month-wise order for estimated quantity of furnace oil on 1st May 2019 for FY 2019-20 i.e. 60 days in advance; this created short supply of RFO which contributed to load-shedding; KE has not executed Energy Purchase Agreement (EPA) with the independent power producers i.e., Tapal Energy and Gul Ahmed Energy which has been duly approved by Nepra; KCCPP and BQPS-II have the provision of dual fuels as per its generation license; however, KE has not yet commissioned both power plants on alternate fuel (HSD); power draw from 500/220kV NKI grid station can be enhanced from current 450 MW - 500 MW to 700 MW - 800 MW so as to have 200 MW -300 MW additional power available from existing NKI 500/220kV grid station; despite Nepra's approval of investment in transmission segment to the tune of Rs. 115.7 billion, KE has not put serious efforts to upgrade transmission system. Consequently, KE could not utilize the excess power available in the NTDC system. The other three points are regarding overloading of Transformers, repair issues of feeders and load-shedding policy based on AT&C losses. Frankly speaking, these three issues are common in all Discos .Higher load-shedding in high loss (theft) areas is a GoP policy throughout Pakistan and is being implemented cruelly and generously. Thus, we have to ignore these points which have been presumably added to make a longer list of KE's default. Show-cause notices and advices have been regularly issued by Nepra covering the following points; i. Excessive load shedding; ii. Failure to adequately increase generation capacity to meet demand; iii. Underutilization of generation facilities; iv. Failure to restore power supply within the permissible time limits; v. Failure to upgrade transmission and distribution system; and vi. Failure to provide secured, safe, reliable and efficient supply of power.  KE has been under financial and management stress for a long time. They wanted to make a killing by selling it to Shangahi Electric without paying up the liabilities and leaving these under a confused legal and contractual state which was naturally not acceptable to the lenders and suppliers. The main issue has been gas purchase payments to SSGC. There is a consensus now among knowledgeable people that KE was privatized (off-loaded in indecent haste) without adequate forethought and sound policy principles under the \"veritable' guidance of IFIs. The administration of that time thought that their guidance should be good enough. In the industrialized countries, a takeover of even a motor garage (workshop) is allowed only to eligible buyers; otherwise the license of the workshop is cancelled.  Nepra has threatened to levy fine on every single violation which can add up to a significant amount. If fines are adequate and proportional to the damages done and calculated to nullify the purported and intended benefits, it can, indeed, discourage future violations. In many European countries, utility is required to compensate the loss and disturbance of consumer. If calculated diligently and according to this norm, KE's current year's profit can be confiscated in lieu of fine. Frankly, that may be the only action people are thinking that may be implemented. Threat of cancellation of license without any elaboration appears to be phony or at best a theoretical legal construct. Cancellation of license can be a highly complicated issue. Who can take over-government's bureaucracy? How good job is being done in other government controlled DISCOs. We have, time and again in this space, argued for a permanent solution i.e. to bring KE at par with other DISCOs (Original privatization agreement provides for such a possible arrangement), taking the generation and transmission functions from it. No case of confiscation is being made here.KE may be allowed to own and operate its generation assets by registering as independent IPP. Transmission assets can be acquired by NTDC under a commercial arrangement. This way, Karachi would come at par with other areas of Pakistan and would be able to benefit from the country-wide creation of generation capacity of 75000 MW by 2030. It would be lot more easier to meet demand and supply deficits of Karachi of 5-8000 MW from this larger pool. This would do away with a feeling of discrimination against Karachi among a section of people. After all, it is said, if something is good for other parts of the country, why shouldn't it be bad for Karachi, except for bygone circumstances. Sooner or later, this may become a festering political problem that may be exploited by politicians, although the federal government has already allocated generously from the new power plants. There are other radical proposals like allowing more companies(geographical distribution)or wire-only with open retail market .In case of KE, these may create more complications, although wire-only model may be a good alternative to privatization of other government controlled DISCOs. The current tariff arrangement is to expire and replaced by a new one sometime in 2021.This is the ideal time and opportunity to implement our proposal. Courts appear to be ready to allow reasonable executive action. New arrangements have to be made before handing over the KE to a powerful party wherein strategic issues may get mixed up. Structural problems have to be resolved. KE has not shown much interest in generation and transmission except in projects wherein there are prospects of making a quick buck and under-hand deals as is an unfortunate common practice in Pakistan in power sector. It can make good money by concentrating on distribution, reducing losses, increasing efficiency and optimize its resources on distribution. It can continue with its generation assets as IPP. Both the parties, GoP and KE, should seriously start working on a new arrangement including this writer's proposal.  (The writer is former Member Energy, Planning Commission.

The Committee may submit their report to the ECC in two weeks time. This decision was taken by the ECC in its meeting held on July 28, 2020 with Prime Minister Advisor on Finance in the chair. The Petroleum Division stated that at present two LNG Regasification Terminals were operational in the country. Total physical capacity of Terminal-1 and Terminal 1-2 was 690 MMCFD and 750 MMCFD respectively. For Terminal-1, SSGCL has contracted regasification capacity/ 630 MMCFD with a peak capacity of 690 MMCFD on best effort basis as and when required and is utilizing it fully through PSO contracted term cargoes. For Terminal-2, PLTL has a contracted capacity of 600 MMCFD with a peak capacity of 690 MMCFD on reasonable endeavour basis, as and when required. At Terminal-2, Pakistan LNG Limited (PLL) is importing two LNG cargoes per month (nearly 200 MMCFD) on term contract basis whereas additional LNG imports are made through spot tenders to meet gas requirements of the country. This 2nd LNG Terminal is under-utilized with average utilization of nearly 62% and 51% during FY 2018-19 and FY 2019-20 respectively, with the drop in demand primarily on account of COVID-19. Terminal utilization may go above 70% with start of 150 MMCFD of RLNG to Karachi Electric , on firm basis, expected in March 2021. Due to under-utilization of 2nd Terminal, regasification tariff was around USD 0.6159/MM8TU and USD 0.7273/MMBTU during FY 2018-19 and FY 2019-20 respectively against levelized tariff of USD 0.4177/M1VIBTU had the Terminal operated at 600 MMCFD.  For 2nd Terminal, regasification rate (MMCFD) vis-\u00e0-vis terminal tariff (USD/MMBTU) was presented. The resulting higher Terminal tariff has caused additional burden of USD 32.5 million and USD 43.2 million during FY19 and FY20, respectively, which has been shifted to the end- consumers of RLNG in the form of higher gas prices. Therefore, in order to enhance utilization of LNG Terminal(s) and reduce Terminal tariff, it would be economical to offer idle/ un-utilized capacity of Terminal(s) to private/third party (ies). The Petroleum Division further informed that regarding excess capacity' if any, at the Terminal(s), beyond the capacity contracted by state-owned companies (SSGCL and PLTL), ECC of the Cabinet on 31st July 2019 decided that LNG Terminal operator(s) may allocate their excess re-gasification capacity of Terminal(s) (not contracted to GoP) to third party (ies) on commercial basis, subject to the conditions stated in the decision. However, besides various commercial and operational issues, ongoing litigations /international arbitration (LDs and GSA termination) between PLTL and PGPCL have been the major barrier in materializing excess capacity, at 2nd LNG Terminal. At Terminal-1, the sponsor is in the process of replacing the FSRU with a bigger ship to create excess capacity. On the directions of Cabinet Committee on Energy (CCoE) dated 2nd April 2020, legal opinion was obtained from the legal  firm appointed by AG for the litigation on PGPCL, indicating that third party access can be given without compromising the underlying litigation. A Summary of June 18, 2020, to effectuate TPA to excess capacity, was considered by CCoE in its meeting of June 20, 2020. In the matter, Federal Cabinet on July 1, 2020 referred the matter to the ECC for further discussion in detail along with the earlier decision on third party (ies) use of excess capacity. The discussion in the Cabinet focused on revenue sharing while maintaining the priority rights of government on use of contracted capacity. Given that sale of un-utilized government contracted capacity has a direct bearing on excess capacity, the two issues were addressed together in this summary. Regarding providing TPA to un-utilized GoP contracted capacity of 2nd Terminal, the most viable option with GoP would be to offer such capacity of Terminal(s) to private party (ies) on short-term 3 month forward visibility basis, keeping in mind the increasing utilization by GoP itself. While offering un-utilized capacity to third party (ies), GoP would continue to have priority rights of Terminal(s) utilization and maintain operational flexibility to be agreed in lending/borrowing agreement for commingled cargo (es). However, it was important to highlight that provision of TPA to terminals may result in shift of some bulk consumers to private suppliers thus increasing take-or-pay risks for GoP. Therefore, it would be imprudent to make any long-term commitments for sale of un-utilized capacity. The Petroleum Division apprised the meeting that various private parties had expressed their interest in availing un-utilized GoP contracted capacity at 2nd Terminal. All interested party (ies), having necessary regulatory authorization and contractual arrangements, may be given access to the available un-utilized terminal capacity, without discrimination. Under this TPA framework, third party (ies) would import LNG, holding title of the commodity (LNG & RLNG). Relevant state-entity (SSGCL, PLL) would only provide regasification services and deliver RLNG at CTS to importing private party (ies) on Ogra determined tariff. TPA arrangements (for excess and un-utilized capacity) would be exercised through agreement between the stakeholders on storage/handling of commingled cargo(es) and would be administered by Ogra in line with clause 6.2(a) of LNG Policy 2011, till promulgation of TPA Rules for LNG terminals. Upon notification of TPA Rules for Terminals by Ogra, it would also provide a mechanism for converting existing TPA arrangements to such Rules, except for gas pricing which will remain a bilateral matter to be settled between the parties. Third party importers of LNG may sell RLNG to end consumers based on a negotiated price in accordance with clause 6.3(b) of LNG Policy, 2011. The Petroleum Division submitted the following proposals for consideration  and approval of the ECC: (I) TPA to excess capacity: ) a) Authorize LNG Terminal operator(s)/state-entities (SSGCL, SNGPL, PLTL, and PLL) to proceed with TPA for excess; (i)  re-gasification capacity, if any (not contracted to GoP) to third party (ies) in accordance with the ECC's decision  July 31, 2019 to the extent of all matters in that decision except for commercial terms, which may be reconsidered, to further safeguard the interests of the government entities; (b)  the fact that tariff for Terminals was offered for entire infrastructure, dedicated use or sale of Terminals' excess capacity and allied infrastructure should entail additional financial benefit to the relevant state-entity (SSGCL, PLTL). A committee headed by Deputy Chairman, Planning Commission,  with Secretaries of Petroleum, Finance and Maritime Affairs Divisions as its members, may be constituted to assess and finalize financial benefit to the relevant state-entity for a policy decision, based on consultations with both Terminal developers, within two weeks and report back to the ECC. (II) TPA to Government contracted un-utilized capacity: (a) Authorize relevant state-entity (SSGCL for 1st Terminal and PLL for 2nd Terminal) to offer the operationally possible un-utilized regasification capacity, as and when available, to the interested  eligible party (ies) on OGRA determined tariff on short term rolling basis (3 month forward) having necessary regulatory authorizations and related contractual arrangements; (b) In case the total requirement of all eligible interested parties  exceeds the total offered capacity, such capacity will be allocated proportionately;  (c) Third party (ies) will import LNG holding title of the commodity (LNG & RLNG). Relevant state-entity will only provide regasification services and deliver RLNG at CTS to importing party (ies); (d) Authorize OGRA to determine margins of relevant state-entities (SSGCL, SNGPL, PLTL, and PLL) and inclusion of such margins in the tariff to be charged to third party (ies); (e) Power Division and Ministry of Industries to firm up its RLNG requirements of at least six months in advance on recurring basis enabling state-entities to assess un-utilized capacity and seek private sector's interest for utilization of such capacity, if any. On July 28, 2020  Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet decided the following on proposals submitted by the Petroleum Division regarding Third Party Access (TPA) to LNG Terminals: (I) Excess Capacity and (II) Government Contracted Un-Utilized Capacity and approved, in principle, the concept of  auctioning the unutilized capacity of the government, and constituted a two- member committee comprising Ali Zaidi, Minister for Maritime Affairs and  Nadeem Babar, SAPM on Petroleum to look into the commercial terms of the proposal. The Committee may submit their report to the ECC in two weeks time.

A government team comprising Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives, Asad Umar, Minister for Energy, Omar Ayub, SAPM on Petroleum, Nadeem Babar and Nepra's team headed by its Chairman Tauseef H. Farooqi have already held a meeting with Chief Justice Supreme Court, Justice Gulzar Ahmed and Justice Ijaz-ul-Ahsan in the chamber of Chief Justices on November 12, 2020 and briefed them about the issues related to KE. Attorney General of Pakistan has also convened a meeting of all concerned stakeholders on Monday (today) to evolve consensus on an out of box solution of KE issues, to be presented to the SC. The sources said, Shanghai Electric is seeking to acquire KE subject to the following four conditions: (i) settlement and resolution of the payment of dues to SSGC and NTDC / CPPA and receipt of dues from KWSB and the Federal Government on the basis of reciprocity for any interest payments; (ii) determination of the mid-term review of the Multi Year Tariff (MYT) by NEPRA; (iii) determination of claims under various components of the KE tariff by NEPRA and; (iv) exclusivity right afforded to KE is maintained, as per the licence. \"KE needs to be made viable to provide electricity to Karachi as required and to be sold to Shanghai Electric,\" the sources said, adding that Shanghai Electric's acquisition of KE remains on the table, but with new management in China, progress has to involve KE shareholders and GoP agreeing to Shanghai Electric's clear preconditions to complete the transaction so that Shanghai Electric can make investments in KE that they committed over four years ago. KE claims that the presence of Shanghai Electric represents a current opportunity of ensuring that KE achieves the required 100 percent growth in power supply in the next 15 years. KE is involved in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in Karachi, Dhabeji, Gharo (Sindh) and Utthal, Vinder and Bela (Balochistan), including all government & public departments. In the next 15 years just Karachi's energy requirements are expected to increase by 100 percent. The GDP of just Karachi represents 25 percent of the GDP of Pakistan, therefore, more than 25 percent of Pakistan's GDP depends on power supplied by KE. KE claims that it also services loss-making areas, where consumers do not pay bills. These are Katchi Abadis, slums, and some of the poorest localities in Karachi, Sindh and Balochistan. The losses caused to KE by servicing of loss-making areas are almost Rs17 billion annually, but working with the community, KE has improved theft and recovery losses by 17 percent in 10 years. In a presentation, the power utility has claimed that recovery ratio improved by 3.5 percent points, distribution capacity increased by 25.6 percent in last 5 years, whereas power sector owned by the government's recovery ratio improved by 2.2 percent points and distribution capacity increased by 12.3 percent in last 5 years. Feeder overloading was 22.9 percent (2020). KE's expected milestones as per approved business plan till 2023 will be as follows: (i) move to power surplus position through addition of 900 MW RLNG plan, off-take of additional supply of 1,400 MW from national grid. For elimination of load-shedding, conversion of all high and very high loss PMTs to Aerial Bundled Cable (ABC). The power utility argued that Nepra's approval of investment and regulatory certainty are the pre-conditions to achieve the targets. \"Nepra's approval of claims filed under MYT to ensure viability and sustainability is critical for KE to raise financing of Rs170 billion to be financed through debt or planned projects in three years,\" the sources added. Resolution/ settlement of dues including mark-up is necessary. KE cannot ensure the uninterrupted supply of energy without the cooperation of NEPRA, NTDC, SSGC/PSO etc. and the Federal Government. KE has further claimed that it owes a principal amount of Rs13.7 billion to SSGC against payment of gas supply. Similarly, KWSB, which is defined as a strategic consumer under the Implementation Agreement (IA), owes a principal amount of PKR 28.3 billion to KE, which is not disputed by the Federal Government. KE has been unable to make such payment because it has failed to receive Rs28.3 billion from KWSB. Under the Implementation Agreement, the Federal Government was responsible for paying KWSB's dues to KE. It was proposed that an adjustment be made between KE, KWSB and SSGC by the Federal Government. Despite negotiating an adjustment, the Federal Government has repeatedly failed to implement such adjustment mechanism. Thus, the principal amounts due from KWSB and KE remain outstanding. SSGC has been charging an excessive and compounding interest on the principal amount owed by KE, which now amounts to PKR 93 billion, while KE did not charge any interest on its receivables, including from the Federal Government. Due to SSGC's insistence on charging excessive and compounding interest and due to KE not charging any interest, KE is at a considerable disadvantage. As previously adjudged by the Federal Government, KE is and has always been willing to pay the principal amount to SSGC upon receipt of the principal amount from KWSB. NTDC / CPPA have a receivable of a principal amount of PKR 143.8 billion from KE. The Federal Government owes KE Rs200.7 billion in Tariff Differential Claims (TDCs). KE has not charged any interest on the principal amount receivable from the Federal Government. NTDC / CPPA have charged interest of PKR 55 billion on KE's payables due to the Federal Government's failure to make timely payments to KE. A set-off mechanism is already agreed between NTDC / CPPA and KE under which the payables of the Federal Government may be set off directly against the receivables of NTDC / CPPA. The Federal Government has failed to set-off the entire amount in a timely manner. The Federal Government has previously successfully set-off amounts under this mechanism. As a result, KE has been subjected to interest and has been deprived of the ability to invest up to Rs200 billion in its infrastructure. KE is of the view that in case the payment of interest, compounded or simple, is chargeable to KE in respect of Rs13.7 billion due from KE the latter should similarly be entitled to charge compounded or simple interest on Rs28.3 billion due from KWSB to KE. In such a case, interest will be paid ultimately by the Federal Government on behalf of KWSB to KE. KE will thereafter make interest payments to SSGC. SSGC will further make such interest payments to OGDCL and ultimately to the Federal Government. In effect, therefore, the payment of any interest on due principal amounts will be made by the Federal Government through KWSB and received by it through SSGC, representing a payment by GoP to GoP. However, in the case interest is charged, the Federal Government will be required to allocate or borrow precious funds to make interest payments on behalf of KWSB, only to receive the same after a long cycle through SSGC. The KE further argues that NEPRA is obligated to determine the multi-year tariff, however despite significant delays and over 2 years of finalisation process, NEPRA failed to determine a sustainable tariff. Additional NEPRA approvals for KE's investment plan for the next 3 years under the tariff Mid-Term Review are also pending for over 30 weeks. Delay in these determinations has adversely impacted KE's viability including borrowings to finance expansions. \"When utility bills are not paid it is recorded as a loss to KE which is currently at around Rs17 billion per year. NEPRA has allowed KE to claim prudent costs under the NEPRA Act. Despite a continuing lapse of more than a year, these claims remain pending,\" the sources maintained. KE filed its externally audited claims for the losses and costs for the last 3 years of about Rs14 billion out of the Rs50 billion recovery loss suffered by KE. This amount of Rs14 billion was to be incorporated in tariffs and thus not be a loss for KE. Due to the non-determination of these claims by NEPRA, KE will effectively suffer additional losses of upto Rs20 billion annually simply due to NEPRA's failure to undertake its own claim mechanism. NEPRA granted KE exclusivity by way of a distribution license dated July 21, 2003 which was to be for 20 years and ends in July, 2023. This was a key pillar of privatisation and incentive to incoming investors to plan their commitments. The power utility has claimed that it made its investments and plans in reliance of the legal representation made by NEPRA in respect of exclusivity in the licence, adding that NEPRA seeks to modify such exclusivity before 2023, it does not provide for any alternative plan or policy for servicing Karachi's needs, including its loss-making areas. On exclusivity, KE says that exclusivity is a material consideration for Shanghai Electric in its bid for KE. In the case Shanghai Electric abandons its acquisition of KE, NEPRA will be jeopardising the provision of electricity to Karachi in the future. KE, in its prayer has requested that the Supreme Court may order to do so on the basis of principal amounts payable and not on the basis of simple or compounding interest as the same has not been charged by KE to KWSB as guaranteed by GoP. Supreme Court may do away with the interest, and its net loss to the Federal Government and direct the Federal Government to set off the claims payable by it to KE against the claims receivable by NTDC / CPPA. KE has further requested the SC to direct the Federal Government to thereafter finalise an agreement between KE and NTDC / CPPA for additional power to satisfy the requirements of Karachi. The power utility has also prayed that Supreme Court may require NEPRA to determine multi-year tariff adjustments including investment plans under the mid term review immediately and to allow the same to be viable. SC may require NEPRA to determine KE's claims under the MYT to ensure the viability of KE and enable execution of required investment.

As the virus took strong hold on the country, declining economic activity and restricted mobility as lockdown continued brought the OMC sales even lower. According to OCAC data, sales of petroleum products by the OMCs in April 2020 was down by 36 percent year-on-year. The largest decline was seen in furnace oil which has been on a downward path for at least a couple of years now. Motor gasoline sales were down by over 35 percent year-on-year; sales of jet fuel were down by 84 percent as flight operation remained suspended. There was a strong rebound in high speed diesel sales on month \u2013on-month basis (42 percent) in April 2020 due to some easing in the country-wide lockdown and the commencement of harvesting of Rabi crop. However, HSD sales remained 16 percent lower than April 2019. OMC sales have been slowing down before the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting lockdown as FO is being replaced with RLNG and coal power plants. At the same time, diesel has been under duress due to slower economic and ensuing transportation activity in the country and continued and influx of grey product; while motor gasoline growth was impacted by falling car sales and rising fuel prices. Overall, OMC sales of the three key products have seen a decline of over 12 percent in10MFY20. The product wise trend has been constant for a long time led by falling furnace oil sales, followed by HSD and petrol (motor gasoline). Where does oil consumption go from here? The future route of petroleum product consumption and sales again rest upon the crude oil prices, and the lockdown/shutdown dynamics. April was expected to be weaker additionally due to Ramadan as all industrial activity usually slows down during the holy month. Flight operation suspension though partially lifted, will continue to adversely affect the consumption of jet fuel. Retail fuels will get some boost particularly HSD during the harvesting season as well as easing of lockdown. Recent downward price revision will also play a role in consumption. News reports suggest that some OMCs held back sales in order to benefit from fluctuating prices, while PSO sold record HSD in the beginning of May 2020.

That the price change came a week before schedule, qualifies as a relief step. The Special Assistant on Petroleum Nadeem Babar had initially hinted that this was a result of a considerable reduction in Petroleum Levy. One was under the impression that the actual benefit of decline in global crude oil prices will follow on April 1, and this is a relief purely based on PL. But there came Ogra\u2019s own details. And the \u201csizeable\u201d reduction in PL reads a paltry Rs2.59/ltr. Another Rs2/ltr have been slashed from the GST. The remaining price cut deals with actual reduction in global Arab Gulf Gasoline prices. This makes one wonders if the government actually passed on the benefit to the consumers or made more money out of the situation. Some math would help. The relevant benchmark crude price for the period from February 27, 2020 to March 23, 2020 averaged $40.43 \u2013 or 35.2 percent lower month-on-month. The rupee did lose some value, but the change in rupees term was almost identical at 34.2 percent month-on-month at Rs39.9/ltr. Now move to the base price for PSO, which is the cost of supply of the refined product. There is a 15.5 percent month-on-month reduction in base gasoline price. Surely, the crude oil undergoes refining process, hence the percentage change in crude and refined products will always vary. But hold on here. Never in at least last four years, has the differential between crude and refined gasoline been this big. The average four-year ratio of base price to crude oil price is 1.08, with the highest value at 1.19 (see table). The ratio suddenly jumps to 1.4 for March 24 announcement. What have the refineries suddenly started to do? Why the sudden spike? What is the explanation there? Had the ratio stayed 1.1 \u2013 the base price would be lower by another Rs12/ltr and the retail price by Rs14/ltr to Rs82/ltr. Nadeem Babar and Co. would do well to explain this price breakup. These are tough times, and criticism may seem out of place. But when you announce measures in the name of relief package, there should be transparency, which is clearly lacking here.

Alex Metcalfe, who recently authored the 'sustainable public finances through Covid-19' report and head of the Public Sector Policy at ACCA said on Thursday that this pandemic could be a catalyst for more governments to adopt the approach of using public sector balance sheets which can improve decision-making, act as the benchmark for new fiscal targets, and support governments to rebuild economies for a more inclusive and greener future. \"The governments must take a balance sheet approach to managing their finances through the Covid-19 crisis,\" he said, adding that the World Bank and the International Federation of Accountants (IFCA) are concerned because public sector fiscal commitments and interventions are not being captured by governments. \"Economic indicators need more clarity to provide a better picture of public sector finances in turbulent times.\" He added that by implementing a balance sheet approach, the benefits the government would take are: Increased clarity on the true position of the public finances with an understanding of the fiscal room available for further government action; improved value for money and financially sustainable decision-making and enhanced public sector resilience and better adoption of key financial metrics to drive performance management. According to Alex, the governments need to avoid poor-value privatizations which provide immediate cash but reduce public sector net worth and minimize reliance on tax increases or austerity by taking a balance sheet approach to foster sustainable public finances. World Bank group director for governance global practice, Ed Olowo-Okere said the pandemic requires that the governments strike a balance between the standard fiscal discipline and control on the one hand, and speed and flexibility in public financial management on the other. To build back better, the ministries of finance need a variety of tools for better management of public money to sustain the wellbeing of citizens, he added. IFAC executive director Alta Prinsloo said no government can go alone - the global nature of the pandemic makes this apparent. Part of this drive toward global best practice is to ensure that, as a profession, we discuss with colleagues and policymakers the future of financial reporting in the public sector. Professional accountants need to be giving non-finance expert decision makers a clear and trusted view of the sector's unfolding financial position, he added. Head of the ACCA Pakistan Sajjeed Aslam was of the view that severity of the current crisis means poor quality accounting data in the public sector is no longer an option. Now is the time to reset current economic frameworks and consider what fiscal rules will guide government decision-making during the recovery phase. He said the privatisation of any public assets and services needs to be carefully considered so that they provide value for money and improve government financial sustainability. \"And we also need to invest in skills and training as they are an important part of the economic multiplier.\" He recommended that the government needs to either reference or use full-accrual International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) in the production of their general purpose financial reports besides directing the independent fiscal policy institutions to begin fiscal sustainability reporting or to increase its frequency. Sajjeed opined that central finance departments should also be required to respond publicly to these reports in a timely manner and provide the \"supreme audit institutions\" with the independence and necessary resources to conduct performance audits which may identify cases where public money was not used effectively, efficiently or economically in combating the Covid-19 crisis.

If either \u2013 the gas pressure or volume \u2013 falls below the minimum threshold required, KE is not able to utilize its gas-based plants at optimum level, and thus a power shortfall occurs which is outside KE\u2019s control. KE faces severe gas pressure issues at three KE generation plants located at Korangi, Ibrahim Hyderi and SITE, which combined result in a power shortfall of up to 350 MW in the system. KE remains in constant communication with its fuel providers and the requirement of adequate gas pressure has been consistently highlighted as a constraint that must be urgently addressed and the same has been raised by KE with concerned stakeholders at government level. Investments on these plants were made after the required gas allocation and approval from ECC with due consideration by NEPRA at the time of issuance of generation license. Furthermore, SSGC has assured the Ministry of Energy that it will come up with a plan to resolve gas pressure issues before next summer as it would be critical to manage peak demand during summer. Regarding the Gas Supply Agreement (GSA) with SSGC, K-Electric remains committed to sign a GSA for gas quantities on firm basis and gas pressure within design limits of KE\u2019s power plants, in line with the decision of the Cabinet Committee on Energy (CCoE) dated April 23, 2018.  K-Electric operates its power plants in line with the Economic Merit Order to meet the power demand. As per the tariff mechanism, fuel cost is a pass-through item, accordingly, there is no incentive for KE to purposefully refrain from operating furnace oil-based power plants if demand exists, and it must be appreciated that the recent power supply crisis was mainly due to shortage of furnace oil supply which was a country-wide issue. During FY20, despite subdued power demand due to COVID-19 lockdown, over 730,000 MTs of furnace oil (over Rs45 billion) was consumed. Therefore, the perception of underutilization of furnace oil-based plants by KE is contrary to the facts and ground realities. Further, as part of our future investment roadmap, KE is adding 900 MW RLNG based efficient generation capacity which also diversifies KE\u2019s fuel mix towards RLNG - a cleaner and cost-effective fuel. In addition to this, KE is also upgrading its transmission capabilities with a view to evacuating additional power from the national grid. In parallel we are also combatting power theft through our loss reduction initiatives and flagship project Sarbulandi with the vision of significantly eliminating load-shed.  We appreciate the release of Rs31 billion from the Government of Pakistan on account of GoP receivables in 2020, as also disclosed in Annual Report 2020. However, despite this release, KE\u2019s net receivables from the Government of Pakistan and various government entities stand at around Rs80 billion on principal basis including dues from the Karachi Water & Sewerage Board and Tariff Differential Claims. This issue of mounting government receivables has forced KE to resort to increased borrowings to fund operational and working capital requirements, which was among the main drivers of increase in company\u2019s finance cost to Rs16.737 billion in FY 20, and consequently the company posted a net loss of Rs3 billion in FY20. With the 900 MW power plant located at Bin Qasim upcoming in 2021 and transmission upgrades to evacuate additional power supply from the national grid underway, the power utility\u2019s financial needs have burgeoned. The issue of government dues has serious ramifications for Karachi\u2019s power outlook as the power utility is aggressively pursuing a USD 1.5 billion capital expenditure plan across the power value chain in next three years. If the vertically integrated power utility will not have the money to operate power plants at full capacity and undertake required initiatives in the T&D segment, and its ability to access cost-effective financing is hamstrung, then the impact will cascade onto Karachi, consequently denting the country\u2019s ability to meet its socio-economic priorities. Despite this payment stand-off, KE continues to prioritize power supply to KWSB pumping stations in recognition of their importance to Karachi and ensures payments of monthly bills to its fuel suppliers including SSGC, PSO and IPPs to ensure continuity of business operations. But the situation is obviously unsustainable, where KE continues to make timely payments but legitimate dues owed to the power utility are delayed, damaging organizational sustainability, affecting KE\u2019s liquidity and potentially deterring the continuous infrastructure investment that the city\u2019s growth needs.  Firstly, I am pleased to share that KE is pursuing its 900 MW RLNG project in combined cycle mode having efficiency of around 60 percent which would not only help KE diversify fuel mix, but also do away with expensive furnace oil-based generation to a large extent. First unit of 900 MW RLNG Project is expected to come online by summer of 2021 and project completion by end of 2021. In addition to the 900 MW RLNG Project, given the uncertainty in continuity of supply from National Grid back in 2015 / 2016, KE\u2019s planned projects included a 700 MW coal project in an IPP mode. However, due to significant incentives to invest in power generation under Power Policies in the past, the National Grid is now in a surplus position from generation perspective, and therefore based on discussions with GoP, KE is now pursuing off-take of additional 1,400 MW from the National Grid, instead of its 700 MW Coal Project. This will not only meet Karachi\u2019s growing power needs in KE\u2019s service area but also reduce the burden of idle capacity payments which has been a major driving factor of circular debt at national level. For off-take of additional power from the National Grid, new grids and interconnections are required, including at 500kV level for which preliminary works have already begun. With regard to grid and interconnection works for off-take of additional power from the National Grid, I am pleased to share that construction of 220kV Grid Station and its associated Transmission line at Dhabeji have started with expected completion by Q3 of FY22, which in addition to off-take of additional power from the National Grid, will also cater to demand growth in the area. Further, scope of 500kV Grid station and associated transmission line connecting to National Grid has been finalized with independent consultant, and it is expected that the tendering process will start by next month, with contract execution targeted by Q3 of FY21. However, it is important to highlight that KE operates under a cost-plus tariff regime, and the power utility is in continuous engagement with NEPRA to allow related investments in tariff, as any delays in required approvals would have a consequential impact on timely completion of these initiatives.  Let us look at this holistically. To say that K-Electric has consistently high transmission & distribution losses is a statement that lacks context, especially if seen in the backdrop of Karachi\u2019s power supply situation before the power utility\u2019s privatization. Since 2005, KE has invested over USD 3.3 billion across its business segments of generation, transmission, and distribution. These investments, which include almost USD 2 billion in transmission and distribution segments, have enabled KE to reduce T&D losses by around 14.5 percentage points since privatization. This is above the industry average where other DISCO\u2019s have either seen a stagnation or increase in their T&D losses, as reported by NEPRA in State of Industry Reports. The significant improvement in T&D losses of the company has resulted in over 75 percent of the service area now being load-shed free, up from around 6.6 percent in 2005, with 100 percent exemption to industries. Furthermore, up till the third quarter of FY20, T&D losses were reduced by a further 2 percentage points as compared to the same period last year (FY19). However, significant drop in demand from industrial and commercial segments owing to the COVID-19 lockdown, along with corresponding increase in consumption of high loss areas on the back of load-shed exemption and inability to carry-out theft detection activities, T&D losses by the close of FY20 were 19.7 percent as compared to 19.1 percent in FY19. The journey does not end here. More than 40 percent of Karachi is unplanned with rampant power theft and the residents belong to low-income households, hence the propensity to pay is incredibly low. This is a prominent challenge for KE. We accepted this challenge and initiated a three-year, Rs10 billion upliftment and infrastructure development initiative named Sarbulandi. Scaling up our community engagement efforts under this umbrella, we are actively and strategically collaborating with communities and driving socio-economic uplift through initiatives ranging from provision of safe drinking water, creation of public spaces as well as other activities aimed at strengthening health, safety, sports and above all else, creating jobs in these areas. Just one year into this project, we have successfully reduced load-shed in parts of Korangi, Landhi, Liaquatabad, Surjani, Orangi and Nazimabad by an average of 2.5 to 4.6 hours a day. However, one needs to be mindful of the fact that theft is a societal menace, be it power or otherwise. It needs a behavioral shift as well as an ecosystem that discourages this behavior through awareness and support of the law and the legal system.  Undertaking business activities in Karachi comes with its own set of unique operational complexities. Power theft, both through illegal abstraction through kundas or via non-payment of bills are a national issue, not just limited to Karachi. Karachi, being mostly unplanned and comprising illegal settlements and shanty towns, is particularly challenging to operate in because of encroachments and other logistical issues posed by these areas that KE also serves. K-Electric has responded to these challenges with some unique fixes. To reduce Aggregate Technical & Commercial (AT&C) losses, and achieve a load-shed free Karachi, KE is scaling up its efforts to combat power theft, by converting existing high loss Pole Mounted Transformers (PMTs) to Aerial Bundled Cable (ABC) and targets conversion of all high loss PMTs by 2023. As part of its wider corporate sustainability and community engagement efforts, KE launched Project Sarbulandi to improve network health in order to provide safe and reliable electricity. This will be achieved via installation of ABC, mitigation of commercial losses and uplifting of areas through community engagement activities. An effective governance mechanism has also been put in place to support investments KE has made in targeted areas. But yes, there is a requirement for collective efforts \u2013 by all stakeholders - to overcome this challenge and create a more sustainable operating environment for consumers and businesses alike. The lack of strict enforcement of anti-theft measures by law enforcement institutions and penalties by the legal system is also a concern as well as a deterrent to the long-term efficacy of KE\u2019s own efforts to curb theft.  K-Electric currently operates five power plants; BQPS-I is a dual fuel plant which can run on both furnace oil and gas, while the other plants in KE\u2019s generation fleet are gas-based. In addition to indigenous gas, all the plants within KE\u2019s fleet generate on RLNG as well. Further, the planned 900 MW BQPS-III will primarily run on RLNG and KE has recently entered into a Heads of Agreement with PLL for supply of 150 MMCFD RLNG. KE\u2019s 900 MW RLNG plant will be a highly efficient plant and will ensure the supply of clean and affordable electricity to the people of Karachi.  In addition to supply from own sources, KE has arrangements with external power producers including the National Grid, Tapal Energy and Gul Ahmed Energy, etc. In last 4 years alone, KE has added over 400 MW from external sources to its system, which includes 250 MW of renewables. Further, KE\u2019s planned additions going forward include around 350 MW of renewable projects under IPP mode, and in this respect, new solar projects having installed capacity of 150 MW have been planned in Balochistan region. Moreover, in addition to off-take of additional supply from National Grid, KE is willing to explore further options in the interest of ensuring uninterrupted power supply to our customers, subject to techno-commercial evaluation.  Shanghai Electric Power (SEP) is a strategic investor and has expressed keen interest to invest in K-Electric and Karachi. However, despite a lapse of four years since the signing of Definitive Agreement, required GoP approvals are still awaited, for which discussions are in progress. We hope that the Government of Pakistan (GoP) will seriously consider the long-term benefits of this move and expedite the approval process. SEP has proven track record and expertise with an accelerated investment plan for Karachi\u2019s power infrastructure. Further, despite delays on the SEP transaction, aligned with its goal of taking Karachi into a power surplus scenario, KE has a robust investment plan of USD 1.5 billion across the value chain for the next three years with initiatives focused on capacity enhancement including the 900 MW RLNG Project, loss reduction projects and improvement in network reliability, safety, and resilience. Completion of SEP transaction will allow implementation of SEP\u2019s investment plan and accelerated technological advancements, which along with SEP\u2019s proven track record and expertise would go a long way in setting a precedent for the power sector at large. Having said that, we are hopeful that investment roadblocks including payment delays and pending approval are addressed in a cogent manner along with a meaningful resolution of the Shanghai Electric transaction, in the best interests of Karachi and Pakistan.

It also imports products like Mogas, HSD JP-1 and FO based on the demand. With over 3500 plus outlets across Pakistan and the largest distribution network, the OMC serves both retail and bulk customers.  Government of Pakistan holds the highest shareholding making up 22.47 percent shares of PSO, according to the latest pattern of shareholding; PSO has strategic investments in storage, refining, aviation, lubricants, and pipeline businesses. including 12 percent in Parco\u2019s White Oil Pipeline Project; 63.6 percent in PRL as its subsidiary company; 49 percent in Asia Petroleum Limited; 62 percent investment in Joint Installation of Marketing Companies, and 50 percent in new Islamabad airport fuel farm; 44 percent in Eastern Joint Hydrant (un-incorporated joint arrangement); and 22 percent in Pak Grease Manufacturing Company Limited as its associate company as per the company\u2019s FY20 annual report.  The downstream oil and gas sector has seen significant up wing and downswing in terms volumetric sales in the last three years. COIVD-19 has been a recent factor in demand destruction that resulted in a down cycle in the volumetric sales by the OMC sector. Overall, over the last couple of years, there have been changes in the energy mix and OMCs\u2019 revenues shifted away from the furnace oil towards coal and LNG. However, the FO has made a comeback during COVID and post COVID times due to the systemic issues in the refining system as well as the power sector.  Being the industry leader PSO has been driving trends in the sector. In FY17 PSO witnessed a growth in overall volumes by 8 percent on a year-on-year basis, compared to a growth ranging between -9 percent to 4 percent in the previous six fiscal years. Rise in volumes along with higher prices and the RLNG business led to 30 percent year-on-year surge in the PSO\u2019s sales revenues and 77 percent growth in the bottom-line.  PSO\u2019s volumetric growth continued in FY18 in white oil segment, especially motor spirit and HSD even though the retail segment faced stiff competition from new entrants, and substantial discounts offered by competitors and the influx of smuggled products like diesel from Iran. However, PSO\u2019s furnace oil volumes declined by 29.6 percent year-on-year in FY18 as government\u2019s priority changed to RLNG and coal for the power sector. PSO\u2019s revenues increased by 20 percent, year-on-year, while profit after tax went down by 15.2 percent year-on-year primarily on account of one-time reversal of deferred tax asset; falling other income and higher exchange losses. FY19 was a challenging year for the oil marketing segment due to the rising competition and economic contraction. While competition increased, margins also squeezed due to falling volumes by the sector. The decline continued for furnace oil, while the retail fuels especially diesel volumes also witnessed a decline due to falling demand from both the industrial sector, and the transport sector along with falling vehicle sales. Moreover, the high interest rate environment along with exchange losses, peaking circular debt and mounting receivables were key factors that dragged the sectors performance including that of PSO. And despite an overall decline of around 38 percent in volumetric sales, PSO\u2019s revenues posted modest increase versus a decline by most of the other oil marketing companies. This was due to a rebound in the the company\u2019s volumes in the last quarter of FY19. the company\u2019s earnigns slipped by 32 percent, which came from higher inventory losses as well as lower volumes, finance cost and exchange losses. In FY19, PSO acquired 52.67 percent stake in PRL, which lifted its consolidated earnings.  In FY20, PSO\u2019s volumes in furnace oil further reduced due to the continuing impact of policy of shifting power production plants to RLNG. On the other hand, in the retail sector PSO experienced an increase in motor gasoline volumes against an overall decline in the industry due to PSO\u2019s increased assortment amid low demand. Industry diesel volumes too were affected due to weak industrial activity, construction activity, and reduced road and rail movement. However, PSO managed to gain volumetric growth.  Along with decline in revenue, decline in gross profit for PSO was mainly due to inventory losses on account of sharp decrease in international oil prices during the year. \u2013 on the other hand, increase in finance cost due to higher average policy rate of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) in FY20 adversely impacted the bottomline. Decline in gross profit and increase in finance cost was partially offset by lower exchange losses and higher interest income recovered from power sector during the year. \nPSO in FY21 and beyond  After a stressful FY20 marked by weaker volumetric growth industry wide, FY21 has seen a revival in sales volumes for the OMCs. What also adversely impacted the profitability of the oil marketing companies in FY20 was the significant inventory losses that came with the historic oil price crash. That too reversed to some extent.  With economic revival in FY21 as seen from the resumption of industrial and economic activity as well as growth in car sales PSO saw a significant growth in volumes of 21.6 percent year-on-year in 9MFY21. Growth in volumes for 3QFY21 was even more pronounced with furnace oil coming back into the mix. Growth for PSO further came from inventory gains, and the turnaround in PSO profitability was also facilitated by no increase in operating expenses as well as a declining finance cost.  Going forward, what is key for PSO, and the OMC sector is the stability in oil prices as well as continued growth in volumes along with the change in price mechanism for petroleum products to fortnightly that will help reduce the size of inventory losses due to volatility in oil prices.

The growth in volumes for PSO was led by furnace oil that rose by 66 percent year on year, followed by HSD and MS growing by 26 and 21 percent year-on-year respectively. PSO\u2019s topline was up by a massive 64 percent year-on-year and besides the volumetric incline, the jump in the OMC\u2019s sales was also due to the surge in petroleum prices.  After reporting record earnings for FY21, PSO reported all-time high profits for a quarter in 1QFY22 where apart from the topline growth, inventory gains and jump in gross profits were also the factors driving earnings growth.  The OMC is expected to have recorded hefty inventory gains during the quarter due to the jump in retail product prices amid rising global crude oil prices.  Despite the rise in other expenses and distribution and marketing expenses, PSO\u2019s operating profits more than doubled with support from other income as well as the topline and gross profit growth. Further support to the bottomline came from lower finance costs on account of lower short term borrowings.  PSO\u2019s earnings surged by more than 2.3 times in 1QFY22 where much of the volumetric growth came from reviving consumption and demand of petroleum products, price increase as well as the company\u2019s increased retail footprint and upgradation in fuel quality. And the same will continue to be the growth drivers for the coming quarters.

Consequently, the price of petrol came down from Rs81.58 to Rs74.52 per litre, kerosene oil's to Rs35.56 from Rs47.44 per litre, whereas the price of high-speed diesel (HSD) recorded a nominal increase of 15 paisa per litre. The reduction, benefiting all segments of society, triggered laurels for the incumbent government. With these reductions, Pakistan boasted of having the cheapest fuel prices compared to other states in South Asia. All of this sounded great. But, merely one month after the said reduction, the government announced a record increase in fuel prices effective 27th June. The hike ranges from 27 percent to 66 percent, depending on petroleum product . This hefty increase drew nationwide condemnation from the same segments of society that had showered praise on the government a month ago. The reduction in oil prices in end May was dramatic but the increase in end June was more dramatic. In between these two dramatic events, in just a month's time, much has happened and exposed. The month witnessed the hoarding, shortage and black marketing of oil products. It effectively exposed the incompetence of country's regulators, the laid back and indecisive style of governance of the oil ministry and its allied departments and raising of questions on the conduct of Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) operating in Pakistan. As always, the month witnessed a non-ending bout of blame-game which inevitably leads to no conclusions and no lessons learned. To pacify the voices of discontent within the ranks of the government, the Prime Minister has constituted a four-member committee to probe the recent shortages of petrol and fix responsibility and re-examine the impact of 27 to 66 percent increase in POL products' prices notified on June 26 following a public outcry and consider making some downward adjustments. The committee is led by Shahzad Qasim, special assistant to the PM on mineral resources and comprises Rashid Farooq, a former member of the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority, Asim Murtaza, Chief Executive officer of the Petroleum Institute of Pakistan, and Naazir Abbas Zaidi, a former executive of Hascol Petroleum and Pakistan State Oil. The structure of the committee, based on former and present government functionaries, speaks for itself. The committee is not expected to deliver independent or convincing conclusions. The work should have been delegated to independent professionals in the field for a meaningful conclusion. The questions that beg an answer are: 1) The wisdom of going for such a dramatic decrease in oil price for the consumer in May. It is understandable that it was necessitated by global oil price reduction, but was it wise to pass on the full impact of it to the public only to be withdrawn after a month knowing fully well that the global oil market is highly unpredictable in these uncertain times? Other neighbouring countries in the region did not pass on any price reduction to consumers and instead built up their cash buffers. 2) When the oil prices had nosed dived, why the government did not build up its inventories and instructed the OMCs to do the same? The countries in the region did build up their inventories and consequently faced no oil crisis in May or June. If the committee can answer these two questions in public interest then they have at least done a part of their job well.

GENCO-III, CPPA, HUBCO and KAPCO, owe a sum of Rs197 billion to the PSO. The outstanding amounts against HUBCO and KAPCO as of October 31, 2020 amounted to Rs53 billion and Rs12 billion respectively. A letter sent to the chief executive of GENCO-III also mentioned the details of financial breakdown of outstanding amount of Rs131 billion, and regretted that no major payment had been remitted to clear the principal overdue amount of Rs69.3 billion and Late Payment Interest (LPI) of Rs62.4 billion. \u201cThe unnecessary delays and insufficient payment against outstanding receivables is further aggravating our precarious financial position as a result of liquidity issues. In view of PSO\u2019s current financial constraints which is attributable to huge outstanding receivables of Rs131.7 billion from GENCO-III, you are therefore urged to take up with the concerned authorities for early release of funds,\u201d the PSO said in the letter. A PSO letter sent to HUBCO said HUBCO had been in default of making payments to PSO against credit supplies since May 2018.  \u201cWe regret to note that till date no major recovery has been remitted to clear the principal overdue amount if Rs23.33 billion and LPI of Rs29.67 billion,\u201d the PSO said. A letter addressed to KAPCO said the total accumulated LPI charges amounting to Rs12.2 billion were outstanding against KAPCO since 2009 and sought early payments to avoid further inflation of LPI charges. The PSO receivable against the Sui Northern Gas Company Limited also reached to Rs110.3 billion against supply of RLNG and furnace oil.  The dues against the PIA also recorded at the highest level at Rs20.8 billion.  Price differential claims from government is Rs9.6 billion. PSO has to pay Rs14.4 billion to refineries.

First, the OMC was able to reverse the trend of falling revenues with FY21 topline growing by 9 percent year-on-year. The growth in topline is a product of both volumetric and price ascend. PSO\u2019s overall volumes as per the OCAC data increased by 24 percent year-on-year in FY21, with the three key products: petrol, diesel and furnace oil climbing by 19, 20, and 90 percent year-on-year.  According to the company, PSO has regained market share in FY21 with its volumetric growth as well as product diversification. Its liquid fuel volumes exhibited a growth of 22 percent resulting in a rise of market share for PSO from 44.3 percent in FY20 to 46.3 percent in FY21. The while oil segment touched the highest ever volumes despite the shrinking jet fuel industry where PSO\u2019s market share rose again from 44 percent in FY20 to 45.2 percent in FY21. The recent all-time high petrol industry volumes are led by PSO where it set an all-time high record in MS with a growth of 21 percent year-on-year, and a rise in market share from 38.7 percent in FY20 to 41.3 percent in FY21. Its diesel (HSD) volumes also increased by 21 percent year-on- year with 140 basis points growth in market share to 47.2 percent. In percentage terms, the highest growth for volumes was seen in black oil (furnace oil) at 53 percent and a jump in market share from 46 percent to almost 52 percent in FY21. PSO\u2019s fat bottomline also benefitted from increase in other income that comes from growth in late payment surcharge income that it collects; no noticeable rise in administrative and distribution costs; and a decline in finance cost in FY21 due to weaker interest rates.  Much of the revival of volumetric sales can also be attributed to upgradation in fuel quality; PSO\u2019s introduction of Euro 5 standard petrol, diesel and HOBC drove volumes. However, there have been other highlights to FY21 as well that makes the year memorable. The company commenced it first EV charging facility in Islamabad and focused on infrastructure as well as technological development where it increased storage capacity, retail presence, digital capabilities - the results of which the company believes has reflected in the company\u2019s strong performance in FY21.

It continues registering profit that reported an all-time high net profit after tax. The PSO made a profit of Rs11.9 billion in the first quarter of the fiscal year 2021-22.\nIts profit was owing to inventory gains that led to its higher profitability in wake of rising oil prices.

FY21 however, has witnessed quick recovery as the lockdown restrictions eased; economic recovery as seen from demand rebound due to resumption of industrial and economic activity as well as growth in car sales \u2013 two key drivers of volumetric sales in the OMC sector \u2013 have brought the sector back to normalcy. Pakistan State Oil (PSX: PSO) \u2013 the largest OMC in the country has seen its volumes grow by around 11 percent year-on-year in the first six months of FY21 on an overall basis. Key retail fuels like petrol and diesel sales by PSO grew by percent, 13 and 19 percent year-on-year, respectively, while furnace oil too has been witnessing a revival in the country\u2019s power mix with PSO\u2019s volumes increasing by 26 percent year-on-year in 1HFY21. Volumes for 2QFY21 were even better with overall growth of around 13 percent year-on-year.  Despite the growth in volumetric sales by the OMC giant, the revenue growth for PSO in 1HFY21 stood weaker by 12 and 8 percent year-on-year in 1HFY21, and 2QFY21. This was primarily due to decreased average selling prices of petroleum products. However, PSO\u2019s gross margins were seen improving, which was due to inventory gains during 1HFY21 versus staggering inventory losses in 1HFY20. Also, a decline in finance cost due to lower short-term borrowings further lifted the net margins. PSO\u2019s net profits for 1HFY21 grew by 48 percent year-on-year, while 2QFY21 growth in earnings was around 51 percent.  The stability in oil prices is key in topline growth. Compared to FY20 where the volatility was very high, oil prices in FY21 are expected yield better prices for PSO, which along with rising petroleum consumption will bring growth to the topline.  Though PSO\u2019s overall market share in 1HFY21 remained stagnant at around 46 percent due to decline in furnace oil share, its share in retail fuels was seen growing from 42 percent in 1HFY21 to 45 percent in 1HFY20. At the same time, the change in price mechanism for petroleum products to fortnightly will also reduce the size of inventory losses in case of oil price fluctuation.

Umar, who is said to have differences with SAPM on Power and Petroleum Tabish Gauhar on several issues, sought clarifications on different points of the policy, including benefits to be reaped by giving incentives to existing refineries.  He asked questions about profits of new and existing refineries. According to Tabish Gauhar, he has revealed that establishment of two big refineries is not possible in Pakistan, hence, both Saudi Arabia and the UAE should work on feasibility of a joint refinery. The Government, through this policy, is providing necessary incentives/facilities to attract investment in this sector. This section, including its sub-sections, outlines the incentives being made available for new deep conversion integrated refinery and petrochemical complex. In accordance with the Pakistan Oil (Refining, Blending, Transportation, Storage and Marketing) Rules 2016, a license from the Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority shall be required for construction and operation of the refinery. No new hydro-skimming refinery shall be allowed to be installed in the country. There shall be no restriction on the selection of equipment, technology or process other than the fact that it must be a deep conversion refinery. According to the draft policy, infrastructure such as Single Point Mooring (SPM), Single Buoy Mooring {SBM), jetties, subsea/land oil pipelines, oil terminals, Petrochemical plants and tank farms shall be treated as separate projects and fiscal incentives shall also be applicable to these projects. Wherever applicable, separate licences will be obtained for the infrastructure projects from the relevant authorities. The government shall not provide any product off-take guarantees. Refineries shall be allowed to sell products to any marketing company, including their own affiliates in marketing and distribution. However, import of finished products by OMCs shall be limited to only projected deficit in accordance with the provisions of Rule 35(g) of the Pakistan Oil Rules, 2016, ensuring uplifting of local refined products first. Locally produced crude shall be allocated to the closest refinery that can handle crude with such specifications. Once allocated, it shall not be cancelled if new refinery comes closer to the crude source, unless mutually agreed amongst the existing user and new proposed user and the Petroleum Division. After uplifting of local crude oil, if so allocated, the refineries shall be free to import crude oil from any source except from prohibited countries with no obligation or guarantee on part of the Government of Pakistan. Refineries will be allowed export of surplus petroleum products, or products with specifications that do not have local demand under the intimation to OGRA and Petroleum Division. No refinery shall be allowed to market, in Pakistan, petroleum products of specifications with inferior quality than those notified by Petroleum Division from time to time, unless it has a waiver from the Government of Pakistan. If it produces products of inferior quality and does not have a waiver to sell it locally, it shall be free to export it. Pricing regime: the product pricing formula of refineries shall be based on \u201c True Import Parity Price\u2019\u201d to be derived from Arab Gulf Mean FOB spot price, or if not published shall be derived from Singapore Mean FOB price. All other elements including premium, freight, port charges, incidentals, import duties, exchange rate, provincial taxes as applicable and other price adjustments shall be added, as per PSO actual imports, in the FOB price to arrive at True Import Parity Price. Additionally, prevalent inland freight of imported crude oil to refineries and provincial duties, levies/cess and taxes (with import duty on crude oil, if any, at import of crude oil) shall be added for refineries. There shall be no import duties and Sales Tax on import of petroleum crude oil with effect from July 1, 2022, being the main raw material, by refineries themselves. The finished products, however, shall be subject to import duties and Sales Tax notified by the competent authority from time to time. There will be no guarantee of rate of return for existing, or new, refineries provided by the regulator or the Government of Pakistan. However, subject to the applicable regulations of State Bank of Pakistan and fulfilling all procedural requirements, refineries shall be allowed to open and maintain foreign currency accounts. They shall be allowed to retain a certain portion of export proceeds in foreign currency, if any, to meet operational requirements, as notified by SBP from time to time. There shall be a tariff protection in the form of 10% import duty on Motor Gasoline and Diesel of all grades as well as imports of any other white product used for fuel for any kind of motor or engine, effective from the date of commission for six years, provided that the refinery starts construction of the project before December 31, 2025. The pricing regime for new refinery projects would be given a pricing mechanism which shall be no less favorable than the prevailing mechanism till deregulation. Fiscal regime: all new deep conversion oil refinery projects of a minimum of 100,000 bpd refining capacity as well as infrastructure projects mentioned in 9.1.1.3 of the policy, to be set up anywhere in the country, that start the construction of the project before December 31, 2025 shall be eligible for the following fiscal incentives: (i) 20-year income tax holiday of all taxes under the Income Tax Ordinance 2001, from the date of commissioning of the project;(ii) exemption from customs duties, surcharges, withholding taxes, or any other levies on import of any equipment to be installed, or material to be used in the projects without any precondition for certification by Engineering Development Board; (iii) exemption from general sales tax, or any other ad valorem tax on the import of any equipment to be installed, or material to be used in the projects without any precondition for certification by Engineering Development Board. The Federal Government shall facilitate for similar exemption of provincial & local taxes ;(iv) construction, operations and engineering services performed in Pakistan, whether by local firms or foreign firms operating in Pakistan, as well as procurement of any local materials shall remain subject to applicable local taxes, whether provincial or federal;(v)  projects shall be exempt from the application of the Companies Profits (Workers\u2019 Participation) Act 1968 and Workers\u2019 Welfare Fund Ordinance 1971. The Federal Government shall facilitate for similar exemption of provincial statutes, if any; (vi) Temporary imports by contractors/sub-contractors of all machinery, vehicles, plant and equipment, other materials and spares in connection with setting-up, operation, maintenance and repair, which are to be repatriated after completion of the works, shall be exempted from all customs duties, taxes, surcharges and levies on import, and shall be released by customs authority on provision of a bond by the importer, for a defined time period of use. Policy structure for existing refineries:  all existing refineries will be encouraged to upgrade and modernize/ expand their refineries to produce environment friendly fuels as specifications notified by the Petroleum Division. There is no restriction on the technology, equipment or process to qualify for such upgradation, provided that it results in final finished products meeting the agreed Euro-V specification notified by Petroleum Division. This could include upgrades and bottom of barrel upgradation, and addition or integration of petrochemicals manufacturing, whether individually or jointly by the existing refineries; upgradation/modernization/expansion projects as committed by the existing refineries as referred to at clause 9.2.3.7, shall be eligible for the fiscal and tariff incentives, to the extent of such upgradation/modernization/Expansion project, as stipulated in the following sections: (i) infrastructure such as Single Point Mooring (SPM), Single Buoy Mooring (SBM), Jetties, subsea/land oil pipelines, oil terminals, petrochemical plants and tank farms shall be treated as separate projects and the fiscal incentives shall also be applicable to these projects. Wherever applicable, separate licences will be obtained for the infrastructure projects from the relevant Authorities; (ii) GoP shall not provide any product off -take guarantees. Refineries shall be allowed to sell products to any marketing company, including their own affiliates in marketing and distribution. However, import of finished products shall be to only projected deficit in accordance with provisions of Rule 3S(g) of the Pakistan Oil Rules 2016, ensuring uplifting of local refined products first. The existing refineries will be allowed a 10-year income tax holiday of all taxes under the Income Tax Ordinance 2001, from the date of commissioning of the upgradation/modernization/expansion and petrochemicals project. For an existing refinery to be eligible for the fiscal incentives provided in this policy for upgradation/modernization/Expansion, it must commit to upgrade/modernize/expand no later than December 31, 2021 and provide an undertaking to the Petroleum Division, which undertaking, among other things, shall include the proposed timeline, potential configuration/units, the tentative product slate after upgradation (ensuring production of Euro- V Mogas and diesel), the size, as well as all other relevant information required by the Petroleum Division to ensure compliance. Upon receipt of this undertaking, Petroleum Division shall provide a waiver for the refinery to continue marketing its products, until the agreed completion date of the upgradation (not later than December 31 2026), from the fuel classifications notified by Petroleum Division. Refineries that do not provide such undertaking, and do not have a waiver, shall not be allowed to sell their products in Pakistan if not meeting the notified fuels specifications, after June 30, 2022. Failure to meet the timelines provided by an existing refinery in the undertaking will initially result in a default notice with an allowed cure period. Failure to meet the milestones, even after the lapse of the cure period, shall result in suspension of the waiver until the timelines are met, with the intent that the Refinery shall not be allowed to market the inferior specification products until it gets back on the agreed milestones and timelines. A \u201cSpecial Reserve Account\u201d for upgradation/modernization/expansion will be maintained by each refinery in a separate bank account to be opened in National Bank of Pakistan. Any incremental revenue (net of taxes) earned by the refineries based on the revised tariff structure (over and above the existing pricing mechanism for refineries), will be transferred to the Special Reserve Bank Account and will appear separately in Company\u2019s books of accounts, which shall be exclusively utilized for upgradation / modernization/expansion projects and will not be utilized for distribution of dividends or adjustment of losses or any other general corporate purposes of the existing refineries. OGRA will monitor the upgradation/modernization/expansion projects and submit quarterly work assessment report to Petroleum Division based on refinery\u2019s work plan. The incremental tariff protection pricing structure of any refinery can be suspended if there is a major irregularity in the work plan found by OGRA till the time the respective refinery achieves the required milestone. The monitoring mechanism shall be as follows:(i) a third-party consultant shall be appointed by OGRA to verify the establishment of the committed projects and to review the progress against committed timelines and key project milestones;(ii)  upon delay/ default, refinery will immediately inform OGRA and Petroleum Division for any unforeseen delay in achieving a committed timeline and underlying reasons ;(iii) in case refinery could not progress with the committed milestone even after a lapse of six months, OGRA shall withdraw the pricing incentives for that particular refinery till such time that milestone is actually achieved. However, once the particular refinery achieves the milestone, the pricing incentive would again be applicable;(iv) if at any stage a refinery decides to relinquish the upgradation project, then it has to pay back all incremental amount, net of already incurred expenditures, earned so far from the revised tariff structure for which the refineries will submit an undertaking by December, 2021;(v) in case of national or political force majeure, no amount shall be paid back by the refinery. For the purpose of this clause, force majeure shall mean any circumstance that are not within the reasonable control and are without the fault or negligence of the refinery which may include: flood, pandemic, tempest or other adverse weather conditions, acts of God, war, insurrection, sabotage, strikes, lock outs or other industrial action, compliance with any acts, regulations by laws, order or restrictions that materially adversely affects the economics and or sustainability of the upgradation/modernization/expansion projects ;(vi) each refinery will submit an extendable bank guarantee of Rs 500  million valid for eighteen months along with the undertaking of upgradation/modernization /expansion  projects  before December 31, 2021. The guarantee (net of any deductions due under this policy) shall be released upon the finalization of Financial close/FID for upgradation/modernization /expansion projects. An annual audit of the Special Reserve Account shall be carried out by the independent statutory auditors of the refinery (who should be one of big four audit firms operating  in Pakistan) duly certified/approved by its Board of Directors;(vii) any incremental revenue (net of taxes) deposited into special reserve account to be used exclusively for the upgradation/ modernization/ expansion and petrochemicals projects shall constitute no more than 40 per cent ( net of taxes of the total project cost) while the remaining 60 per cent is to be funded by the refineries on their own balance sheets in the form of corporate debt and / or sponsors equity. Balance in the special reserve account exceeding 40 per cent of total cost of project, verified by the independent auditors (from big four audit firms), shall be settled through a mechanism to be devised by OGRA. The objectives of this policy include a shift to complete deregulation on pricing, within a defined time period to be reviewed by the Government of Pakistan to allow the benefit of competitive forces to pass on to the consumers. Refineries that choose to upgrade will be given tariff protection for 6 years\u2019 time period after which there shall be a deregulated market, in consultation with refineries, where all refineries will compete with each other, existing and new, as well as with imported products. Clause 9.1.1.4 shall remain applicable to restrict dumping or it may be ensured by way of imposing appropriate anti-dumping duties. The final design of the fully deregulated market environment will be evolved, with participation of all stakeholders, in due course. However, the principle to be followed will be that all Oil Marketing Companies will be free to set the prices themselves, based on the quality of fuels, the location (including abolishment of the Inland Freight Equalization Margin (FEM) and other value- added services being provided. This is already being done for Hi Octane Ron 97 today. However, even in this environment, the product pricing at the pumps operating under the banner of Pakistan State Oil shall set a market benchmark, since PSO has the largest footprint across the country and is majority owned by the government. Other OMCs may charge more, or less than the PSO prices depending on the level of service, convenience of location, or quality of services, that the market can bear. The target date for full deregulation is December 31, 2027. The mechanism for deregulation will be finalized in consultation with all the stakeholders.

For those unaware, it is the amount government settles with refineries and importers at a later stage, ideally when prices cool off. This is not a cash handout to refineries and importers. It increasingly appears reducing the Petroleum Levy further is not an option as reports claim the IMF is insistent on getting as close as possible to the elusive PL target. So the increase in ex-refinery prices has been compensated with a proportionate appropriation on account of PDL \u2013 Rs10.79/ltr for petrol, and Rs7.7/ltr for HSD. The plan is to hope for international crude oil prices to cool off going forward, and then the PDC amount will be added back to the base price. Hope is not a strategy, but faced with mounting pressures from all fronts, and the previous increase in excess of Rs10/ltr, something had to give. Without the PDC, continuing with existing PL and GST, petrol price for first November fortnight would have been Rs150/ltr. Surely, there is no political capital to take that route. The reference Arab Light crude oil averaged $100/bbl for the period. There are emerging views that oil may well have peaked for now. If that is the case, the opportunity to reverse the PDL could come sooner than later. That said, this cannot go on for longer than, another price revision or two, at best.  The financial impact for the first fortnight works around Rs9-10 billion, assuming average three-month trailing demand. This may not be a substantial number for the likes of government owned PSO but could cause worries for smaller refineries. Only bright side to the story is that new prices have been tested without hurting demand (although reduced smuggling could well be masking that). This gives cushion to the government to levy higher taxes, and reverse the PDC, without necessarily having to feel the urge to reduce retail prices.

Earlier, in 2015, when the then government made its long-term contracts with Qatar and Gunvor (both at 13.37%), the rate was about 15 percent higher than the long-term market rate at that time. Then later in 2017, Pakistan entered two contracts with Gunvor (11.62%) and ENI (11.99%) at around 10 percent premium to the prevailing market rates. The comparison of the old deal with Qatar at 13.37 percent in 2015, with the latest deal at 10.2 percent in 2021 is not right as the overall market rates of LNG are moving downwards. Apple to apple comparison would be based on whether long-term contracts entered by other parties at that time were made at higher or lower rate. Based on these, Pakistan paid a premium of around 15 percent in 2015, 10 percent in 2017 and none in 2021. This makes 2021 deal the best so far.  In 2015, Pakistan was a new market, and thus carried risks associated with a new market. Prior to 2015, there were two attempts to buy LNG from Qatar; but did not materialize. The Supreme Court came in the way once; and the government herself moved away the other time. With this backdrop, a premium to the market in 2015 is partly justified. However, having a long-term contract of supplying 5 cargos a month for 15 years without the option of price re-opener in 10 years was questionable. The LNG market norms are that whenever a new player comes in, it establishes itself by buying in spot and short/medium contracts for initial 2-3 years, before entering a long-term contract. But Pakistan at that time made a long-term contract in haste.  Now Pakistan has a history of buying long-term and spot for good six years. The market size is established and forecasted to grow as domestic gas supply is falling every year. Having a better deal is natural. The PTI government had been trying for 1.5 - 2 years to get this deal. The PM wanted it at 9-9.5 percent, but Qatar was offering nothing less than 10.5 percent.  The negotiation had been taking place for quite some time. Early last month, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) went to Qatar and asked for a deal at 9.99 percent. But Qataris didn\u2019t want to give anything below 10.2 percent, as the recent contracts of Qatar with China and Singapore were at the same rate \u2013 the market rate. 10.2 it is. To make the effective rate low, sweeteners have been added in the deal by the petroleum ministry. As compared to the past deals, there will be additional port charges ($80,000 per cargo) to be paid by Qatar. This brings the effective rate to 10.13 percent. Then, the deal is of supplying 24 cargos a year (till 2024, and 48 cargos thereafter till the expiry of contract in 2031) and Pakistan has the flexibility to change the monthly run rate - higher than 2 cargos/month can be shipped in winters (when the spot prices are high due to higher demand) and less than 2 cargos/month in summers (when the spot prices are lower due to low demand). This summer-winter arbitrage makes the effective rate even sweeter. Thus, the effective price Pakistan shall receive from Qatar is probably the best offered to anyone publicly. Even though the rack rate of deal is market based, there are several layers of sugar coating, meaning Pakistan has made this sweet deal as part of a package. The country level decisions include sending manpower to Qatar (to boost home remittances) and defence ties. Clearly, it is more than a mere commercial deal.  The one criticism could be that it places most of the eggs in the Qatari basket. Buyers usually diversify the portfolio to reduce the supply risk. There are other suppliers such as Russia, Malaysia, Indonesia, US, Australia etc. The question is why Pakistan didn\u2019t go to another big player. There are several explanations, the obvious being that the benefits of a package deal \u2013man-power supply and defence contracts- more than outweighs the risk associated with lack of diversification. Just like a couple of years back, India entered a deal with the US for other strategic reasons. The point is that in G2G contracts worth $3 billion, getting something more than the commercial terms in return is worth its while.  The irony of the matter is that in 2015, despite paying premium ($15 billion for 10 years) Pakistan got nothing in return. When PTI assumed power, PM went to Qatar and got a credit line of $2-3 billion at a discount to market interest rates. That can be termed as Pakistan\u2019s discount on 2015 deal \u2013 but the deal was done by PML-N while the PTI got the discount. Some are criticizing why Pakistan did not go for open bidding in 2021. The experience of 2015 suggests that it is better to enter a G2G negotiated deal. In 2015, Pakistan entered open bidding. The best rate it received was 13.37 percent from the usual set of traders. While Qatar did not participate in open bidding, it matched the rate. One can argue that had Pakistan gone for open bidding in 2021, market could have offered 10.5 percent and it would have been difficult to get 10.2 percent from Qatar. Moreover, there were talks of open bidding in the background chatter. Secretary Petroleum called on PSO, PLL and other stakeholders for open bidding. They were against any long-term contract and wanted to continue with spot buying. The argument was that spot buying is better for demand management, and the country should avoid take or pay contract. The long-term contracts were for 8 cargos till last year. After expiry of one Gunvor contract, only 7 are left now. In 2022, another contract will expire. This will leave 6 cargos a month in take or pay. The new deal takes the sum back to 8 cargos till 2024 and 10 cargos after that. With falling domestic gas supply, this is not a case of oversupply. The only question is whether this will leave even less room for the private sector to come in to play.  The criticism of preferring long-term contract over spot buying is uncalled for. Even the private players would like to lock in long term contracts. The spot rates are generally high and controversial. The usual suspects \u2013 Vitol, Gunvor, Trafigura etc, participate in Pakistan. Officials at PSO, PLL, SSGC etc probably have \u2018good terms\u2019 with these players and don\u2019t want them to be out of the game.  Thus, the latest deal will generate significant savings as compared to the last deal. Assuming Brent at $60/barrel, Pakistan is paying $26 million per cargo, and in new deal, the rate would be $20 million per cargo. The savings of $6 million per cargo will result in $144 million a year till 2024 (24 cargos a year), and $288 million per year 2024 onwards (24 cargos a year). In case of 2015 deal, the price opener is after 10 years. By any stretch of imagination, the new deal is a better one.

He said that the fuel stations will also remain closed in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan, adding that they will chalk out their future line of action if their demand is not met. According to a handout issued by the association on Wednesday, the strike will continue for an indefinite period. \"The promise remains unfulfilled to date ...

Presently, a total 66 OMCs are operating under licence, with top 8 OMCs holding 92% of the market share.   The sources said 36 OMCs that acquired licences but did not build storages as per the agreements and allegedly traded only in Iranian diesel, are being issued final notice for closure.     However, those OMC which gave commitments to build infrastructure but showed very little progress are being given a one-year deadline to complete their infrastructures, otherwise their licence will also be scraped, the sources added.   \"Very strong worded letters have been sent by Ogra to those OMCs which have not completed their infrastructures as agreed at the time of issuance of licence,\" the sources maintained.    In March this year, the Cabinet directed Petroleum Division to immediately initiate action against the aberrant OMCs and fuel stations as well as embark upon the necessary administrative and legal reforms in light of the recommendations of the Petroleum Commission's report. The Cabinet took the following decisions: (i) necessary action against OMCs and fuel stations be initiated by the relevant entities; (ii) requisite administrative measures be taken; and (iii) legal reforms/amendments in laws/rules/procedures be initiated and placed before the CCLC.   The Inquiry Commission, headed by Additional Director General Abubakar Khudabakhsh, who is now attached to the team investigating the Jahangir Khan Tareen case, reported that MoEPD-Ogra has the power to inspect minimum stocks of 20 days by OMCs. The decision about import embargo was controversial.   The Commission which conducted an inquiry of the petrol crisis in 2020 had recommended that on controversial holding of PRMs non-observance of import quotas by OMCs, inaction on deficient stocks of OMCs, intrusive involvement of OCAC and non-lifting of local refined products by OMCs from refineries, punitive/departmental action should be taken against the delinquent officers/officials. It further recommended formulation of draft of new oil rules, reliable data collection and an analysis mechanism and appointment of professional and qualified individuals.  The commission contended that unlawful operations of private storage companies, unlawful joint ventures and hospitalities among OMCs, non-adherence to import and local quota allocated to OMCs in Product Review Meetings (PRMs) are some of the reasons for the petrol crisis. The Commission stated that silence of OGRA on specifying minimum stocks, on development of strategic storage, and illegal provisional marketing licences to OMCs were also key factors behind the crisis. The Commission had recommended punitive/ department action against officials/ officers and termination of OGRA.   On OMCs, Commission observed violation of licencing conditions, maneuvering of vessels berthing at ports and non-maintenance of 20 days stocks.   OMCs are involved in underutilizing the import quota, importing petrol in excess of storage capacity, importing petrol despite no retail outlets, disregard for safety protocols, and unlawful interrelated interest of Vitol with different OMCs.   The Commission recommended recovery of monetary liabilities, Equitable distribution of loss borne by PSO among delinquent OMCs, revitalization of the role of DCs to inspect the stock of OMCs and cancellation of provisional marketing licences and development of strategic storage.    The Commission has also recommended that all illegal outlets be closed, in addition to punitive action against retail outlets selling smuggled or adulterated products.   Other recommendations of the Commission were as follows: (i) maintenance of oil piers; (ii) halting of unlawful usage of storage through MoEPD; (iii) construction of pipeline from Keamari to FOTCO, Port Qasim; (iv) elimination of the role of OCAC in berthing, PRMs, IFEMs, data collection.

Hubco, which is in financial trouble after the resignation of its CEO Khalid Mansoor (now appointed as SAPM on CPEC), recently terminated services of a number employees in addition to slashing salaries of senior technical people working on the plant.   Pakistan State Oil (PSO) has also written several letters to the government, seeking help to get billions of rupees due \"receivables against supply of oil to Hubco power plant\" in recent months. The last letter was written on August 11, 2021 for payment of RFO supplies during July-August 2021. In the third quarter of FY 2020- 21, the government approved an amount of Rs 57.981 billion for Hubco in accordance with a renegotiated deal of which 40 per cent was paid on June 4, 2021. However, the government has deduced Rs 11 billion against fuel supplied to Hubco plant for first fill of plant after two decades with the help of an influential institution which facilitated the deal. However, the government has put on ice a proposal of SAPM on Power and Petroleum Tabish Gauhar regarding purchase of plant to terminate it.   According to the concept paper of Tabish Gauhar, Hubco (1200MW) is an almost-idle IPP asset in South Balochistan with around 1% dispatch factor. Its PPA is expiring in 2027.   According to him, even with the recently negotiated (MoU) tariff decrease, GoP has to pay almost Rs260 billion to Hubco in take-or-pay capacity charges until 2027 (without almost no need for their power now or envisaged) which adds to the overall power sector's cost of generation and circular debt. He maintained that one possible option for resolving this issue is an early buy-out / termination of Hubco which is also envisaged under their contract and for the GOP to take over this oil-fired power plant. The payable upfront amount is calculated to be roughly Rs. 65 billion. However, there would be little to no use for GoP of this oil-fired plant that ranks very low on the economic / dispatch merit order. An alternative option is that GoP agrees to pay Rs. 65 billion to Hubco in lieu of Rs. 260 billion if this money is explicitly earmarked / ring fenced by Hubco for: (i) financing the conversion of 600 MW of their oil-fired units to Thar Coal and selling that power to K-Electric under a private-to- private PPA with no GoP involvement. That will also reduce, albeit partially, GoP's liability / responsibility toward continued support for KE's growing future power needs; and (ii) financing the conversion of their remaining 300-600MW power units to produce up to 300 million gallons per day of desalinated water for supply to Karachi under a Water Purchase Agreement with GoP & GoS on mutually agreed terms & conditions (including any \"at-source\" deduction between GoP & GoS for the water charges). A preliminary pre-feasibility study (including costing) has been done by Hubco on this. Tabish Gauhar claims that both the proposed initiatives may be financed under the Karachi Transformation Plan. Another advantage of this proposal for GoP is the potential release of a $12.5 million annual payment liability toward Asia Petroleum Limited (APL) pipeline (that was set up to supply furnace oil to Hubco but is now lying idle) and passing that on to a neighboring oil refinery for their future usage to reverse pump their diesel and petrol products across Pakistan in lieu of the current practice of tank lorries / road transportation. He further noted that transportation of incremental Thar Coal to Hubco (and also Jamshoro, Lucky Power, etc.) via the Thar Rail Link proposal should be an integral part of the Pakistan Railways' revival plan and would also help in reducing the overall cost per ton of Thar coal (due to economies of scale) for the overall benefit of Pakistan's power sector (lower tariff, circular debt, etc.).

According to the report this was achieved without incurring any additional capital expenditure but only through changes in operational philosophy. On comparing figures of first quarter for financial year 2021 with those of corresponding quarter for previous financial year, it can be seen that company\u2019s fixed assets in category of property plant and equipment increased only by 10% indicating maintenance level capital expenditure. Inventories stores however, saw an increase of 32%. Trade receivables were down by 42%. This can be either due to more efficient recovery or a decrease in revenue, which fell by 51% in this quarter on YOY basis. However, Gross Profit reduced only by 12% indicating more effective cost control. Overall Cash Balances were down by 98% this quarter on YOY basis while cash from operations reduced by 126% going into negative. Correspondingly, running finance increased by more than 20 folds as compared to one year ago in all probability indicating company\u2019s efforts to meet cash shortfalls through increased running finance arrangements.   Accumulated Loss has also increased by 72% as compared to corresponding quarter of previous financial year. However, share capital has increased by 114% while long term borrowing increased only by 5%, which is a sign of company\u2019s decision to use share capital for long term financing. Both distribution and finance costs fell by 20% and 32% respectively while administrative costs increased by 11%. Profit after taxation increased by 55%. However, EPS fell by 17% despite an increase in profit after taxation due to increase in share capital.

Historical information since 2016 indicates that despite accumulated losses company has been able to generate revenue more or less steadily. However, its gross profit margin has not shown this consistency and became negative in 2019 and 2020 bringing net profits and EPS into red as well. Increased financial charges in 2019 and 2020 contributed to further decrease in net profits in both 2019 and 2020.

It may be noted that FY 2019-20 is not a true reflection of demurrages impact due to depressed demand and reduced imports as a result of Covid-19 and slowdown of economy. The oil industry has done some further analysis with an objective to quantity the impact of factors such as non-availability of night navigation, intermix handling monsoon season, traffic of LNG vessels and many other miscellaneous factors which are currently impacting discharge capacity resulting in handling of much lower tonnage. It is evident from the analysis that FOTCO is able to handle 6 million tons/120 vessels on annual basis with a single jetty which is below the supply chain requirements of the industry and the country. PARCO/PAPCO have completed their multi-grade movement projects, whereby petrol would also be transported through pipeline in addition to diesel. Presently, petrol is predominantly handled at KPT. Commissioning of multi-grade movement, which is in progress, would necessitate diversion of import handling of about 2.5-3.0 million tons per annum from KPT to FOTCO/PQA, as the pipeline initiates at PQA. However, this would result in higher demurrages at the expense of OMCs as well as causing foreign exchange drain due to the discharge constraints at FOTCO/PQA. Similarly, the oil industry has also raised some integrity and maintenance issues at Oil Piers (OP) 1, 2 and 3 at Keamari Port. Presently, all three oil piers at KPT are operating at partial capacity mainly due to issues of loading arms and required repairs.  The fully operational and well- maintained oil piers are vital for efficient marine receipt operations translating into improved product availability, efficient oil pier operations and avoidance of demurrage/forex losses for the country.  In order to have effective management/maintenance of oil supply/logistic chain, Petroleum Division has proposed that Ministry of Maritime Affairs may be directed to initiate/ensure the following steps/actions in consultation with the respective port authorities on a fast-track basis: (i) FOTCO may be converted to a purely finished products/fuels jetty. Accordingly, condensate/Naphtha export vessels may be shifted from FOTCO/PQA to Keamari/KPT; (ii) a dedicated tanker discharge line from FOTCO jetty to White Oil Pipeline may be installed to handle discharge of petrol and diesel cargoes separately; (iii) night navigation facilities may be provided at FOTCO/PQA; (iv) implementation of channel widening plan of PQA for LNG vessels may be expedited; PQA has been charging amount per vessel for this already; (v)  off-shore sampling may be carried out in minimum possible time. This will reduce time at berth; (vi) construction of an additional petroleum jetty at Port Qasim may be expedited; (vii) necessary repairs/arrangements for integrity and maintenance at the three Oil Piers at KPT need to be ensured as early as possible and; (viii) facilitation may be provided to PSO for its project relating to pipeline connectivity between KPT and PQA for flexibility of operations and security of supply chain of petroleum products.

The meeting constituted a committee on intervention price for cotton crop of 2021-22 with the instruction to submit a report within 15 days. The ECC was informed that lower cotton production is hampering the industry's growth, textile exports, and elevating imports bill of edible oil as well as raw cotton, and livestock meal, besides causing economic insecurity in rural areas, etc. The Agriculture Policy Institute (API) has calculated the cost of production as Rs4,406 for Punjab and Rs3,960 for Sindh. The stakeholders have recommended the intervention price of Rs4,500-5,000/40kg of seed cotton for the year 2021-22. A summary presented to the ECC reveals that the Ministry of NFS&R told the meeting that cotton, being the life-line of Pakistan's economy, achieved a production of 14.1 million bales in 2004-05. However, for the last four years, the cotton production declined to 9.18 million bales in 2019-20 and 8.98 million bales in 2020-21 mainly due to area decline in Punjab and a thin profit margin in cotton as opposed to other crops such as sugarcane, maize and rice. Pakistan can potentially produce 20 million bales in 3-5 years provided farmers are supported with appropriate technology and ensured a fair price. In the past, Pakistan procured cotton through the Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) five times during 1998-2010. A comparison of intervention period with that of non-intervention period reveals that cotton area end yield has increased during the TCP intervention period, and decreased during the period without intervention (2011-2020) The Food Ministry moved similar summaries (intervention price of cotton) twice in 2020; however, the ECC did not agree to the proposals. Subsequently, the cabinet constituted a committee consisting of ministers for Foreign Affairs, Ministry of National Food Security and Research (NFS&R), the Economic Affairs Division (EAD), and the Advisor to the Prime Minister on Climate Change to deliberate upon the issues and re-submit the case. On the summary moved by the Ministry of MNFS&R, the ECC directed the Minister for National Food Security on May 21, 2020 to hold a structural discussion with the provinces to evaluate various options of promoting cotton cultivation and extending support to cotton growers. As a result of consultation, the Punjab Agriculture Committee headed by the governor Punjab recommended an incentive package of Rs5,000 as support price and a grant subsidy of Rs15,000 per acre for cotton growers to enhance cotton production. As the cotton sowing has already started, it is high time to encourage cotton growers by announcing intervention price to procure two million bales of cotton. A Cotton Price Review Committee (CPRC) will monitor the cotton prices in local and international market at weekly intervals. Public intervention through TCP will come into effect on the recommendations of the CPRC, when market prices of seed cotton would drop 10 percent below Rs5,000/40kg and would continue till market recovers. In order to promote cotton production in the country, bring stability in the domestic market and ensure fair return to the farmers, the Ministry of NFS&R proposes that: (a) total of two million bales may be procured by the TCP involving Pakistan Cotton Standard Institute (PCSI) for quality and standards checks; (b) Constitute a Cotton Price Review Committee (CPRC) to review market price and propose intervention at fortnightly bases; and (c) provide a cash credit limit (CCL) as required by the TCP to procure initially for one million bales of cotton at intervention price, in addition to incidental charges of about Rs8.15 billion, as financial and administrative cost, etc. The approval of the ECC of the Cabinet is solicited to the proposals made vide pars. On a summary of the Maritime Affairs Division, the ECC directed the Petroleum Division, Finance Division, and PSO to provide a timeframe for payment of the outstanding dues to Pakistan National Shipping Corporation (PNSC). On a summary about extension of general subsidy on five essential items being sold at the Utility Stores Corporation (USC), the ECC allowed extension in subsidies for 15 days from July 1 onwards and constituted a committee to work out future course of action within 15 days. On a summary of the Power Division about payment of outstanding amount of net hydel profits, the ECC asked the Power and the Finance divisions to come up with a possible solution/option for raising required financing by the Wapda, within two weeks.

The letter is in relation to investigation and inspection proceedings of Hascol Petroleum Limited, for which legal opinion is solicited. The purported facts of the case are as follows - the present status of investigation u/s 257 of the Companies Act, 2017: accounts of Hascol Petroleum Limited for the half year ended June 30, 2019 were examined and it was observed that figures reported for the first quarter ended March 31, 2019 were \"revised' substantially. The offsite wing issued an Internal Recommendation Note (IRN) for initiation of investigation u/s 257 of the Companies Act, 2017 (the Act) primarily in view of misstatements in the financial statements and deteriorating financial position of the Company as per financial statements. Show Cause Notice (SCN) u/s 257 of the Act was issued to all the directors of the Company on October 4, 2019 and the same was issued to the Company through addendum dated November 6, 2019 querying as to why independent inspectors may not be appointed to investigate affairs of Company with major focus on the Company's financial statements where in it had disclosed that it has been importing the fuel through Vitol (Dubai) which accounted for 77% (2016); 79% (2017); and 68% (2018) of the total fuel purchases of the company. It is observed that the company is prima facie, purchasing petroleum products at relatively higher prices in comparison to other listed companies. For instance, PSO's average declared price was $ 530, $ 547 and $ 621 per ton in January, February and March 2019, respectively. M/s Shell, $ 553, $ 524, $565 per ton, Total Parco, $ 535, $ 530 and $ 572 per ton, Attock, $ 630, $ 515 and $ 531 and M/s Hascol $ 659, $629 and $ 613 per ton, respectively. Accounts for the year ended December 31, 2018 depicted that the company purchased LPG plant from Marshal Gas (related party). One of the Directors of the Company namely Liaquat Ali holds 2.2% shareholding in Company and is also major shareholder of Marshal Gas (Pvt.) Limited (holding 6.44% shareholding of the Company). Further, Fossil Energy (Pvt) Limited holds 10.66% shareholding in the Company and Saleem Butt, Chief Executive of the Company is also a major shareholder of Fossil Energy. It was observed that the financial statements of Fossil Energy for the year ending June 30, 2018 reflect that Fossil Energy has entered into a joint venture agreement with Vitol (holding 27% shareholding as on June 30, 2019). The Audit Committee of the Company comprises three members as per information disclosed in the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. Out of the three Directors, two are representing related parties. Liaquat Ali is a common Director of Marshal Gas (Pvt) Limited and Abdul Aziz, is a nominee Director of Vitol. The funds generated through the right issue amounting to Rs3.7 billion primarily to fund the upcoming projects including development of storage facilities, retail outlets and lube oil and grease blending plant prima facie \"were not utilized according to the stated purpose\". During the examination of half yearly accounts of the Company for the period ended June 30, 2019 it was observed that the first quarter accounts for the period ended March 31, 2019 have been \"revised\" substantially. Prima facie the revision of the figures appears as follows: (i) the  amount of other revenue decreased by Rs. 100 million; (ii) cost of sales increased by Rs. 2.86 billion; (iii) gross profit decreased by Rs. 2.96 billion;  (iv) profit before tax amounting to Rs 966 million has been revised to loss of Rs 5.45 billion; (v) earnings per share of Rs 3.73 for March 2019 has been revised to loss per share of Rs 28.87; and (vi) other expenses have increased to Rs 3.46 billion. The Company's replies of October 24, 2019 and November 16, 2019 were analyzed and a hearing was fixed for November 21, 2019 before ED (CSD)/Authorized Officer (AO). Meanwhile, the Company filed a petition in the Sindh High Court (SHC) against the SCN. SHC on November21, 2019 adjourned the matter for two weeks and directed: (i) the Commission to file its comments; and(ii) the Company/Petitioner, \"...to file appropriate reply against the Show Cause Notice and may appear before the concerned authority for appropriate orders...\". The Company, through its authorized representative, attended the hearing fixed by the Commission on November 21, 2019 and requested that: (i) the Company be given an opportunity to clarify the matter; and(ii) sought time of 4 to 6 weeks to submit necessary documents/clarification in relation to the SCN. Authorized Officer allowed time of 3 weeks to the Company to submit the necessary information/documents. In SHC the matter was fixed for December 6, 2019; para-wise comments on behalf of Commission were submitted with the request to dismiss the appeal being infructuous as the Petitioner had made appearance before the Commission in the matter. The Counsel for the petitioner sought further time from the Court. The Court adjourned the matter till second week of January. Pursuant to the hearing held in the office of AO, the Company submitted some documents. The matter was fixed for hearing before AO on January 2, 2020 which on request of the Company was re-fixed for January 9, 2020. The Company vide its letter dated January 08, 2020 requested for further adjournment which was not acceded to and the counsel was advised to attend the hearing on January 9, 2020. The newly-appointed authorized representative & the Company Secretary attended the hearing and requested for adjournment of hearing, which was not acceded to Company filed an application in the SHC on the grounds that SECP had not accepted the adjournment of hearing request of the Company. The Court, in its order of January 10, 2020, directed SECP not to pass final order till next hearing. The letter also says that interim order had further been extended up to next date of hearing i.e. February 14. According to the letter, fresh proposal for inspection u/s 221 of the Companies Act, 2017 was also submitted which says the offsite wing examined the annual audited accounts of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2019. In view of major \"anomalies\" observed, an IRN for initiation of inspection into affairs of the Company under section 221 of the Act has been received from the Offsite Wing. The following major issues have been highlighted therein: (i) the Company in its annual audited accounts for the year ended December 31, 2019 declared massive losses which have wiped out the equity. The auditor of the Company (Grant Thornton Anjum Rahman, Chartered Accountants) reported material uncertainty w.r.t. Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Performance of the company when compared with the previous reported quarterly accounts for the quarters ended March 31, 2019, June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2019 have \"revealed\" the following: (i) Company's equity which was Rs. 1.06 billion as on June 30, 2019 is eroded and now stands at Rs. 8.9 billion as on December 31, 2019; (ii) total assets exceeded total liabilities by Rs. 1.06 billion on June 30, 2019, which now is reversed and its total liabilities exceed its total assets by Rs. 8.9 billion as on December 31, 2019; (ii) current liabilities exceed the current assets by Rs. 43 billion as on December 31, 2019; (iv) the Company in the quarterly results for the quarters ended March 31, 2019, June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2019 disclosed gross profits for each declared result, however in the annual result for the same year ended December 31, 2019 declared a gross loss of Rs. 1.85 billion; (v) the net loss of the Company which stood at Rs. 11.16 billion on June 30, 2019 is now further increased to Rs. 25.87 billion as on December 31, 2019. The letter also says that Hascol made PSX announcement for transfer of shares owned by Mumtaz Hassan Khan on January 24, 2020 to Vitol. The examination of replies received revealed that an amount of Rs1.186 billion on account of above transaction is received in Hascol bank account on November 14, 2019 from Vitol. Restatement of figures of year 2018 in the annual accounts for the year ended December 31, 2019 on account of unaccounted liability of Vitol Bahrain (Rs.977 million) and other adjustments including Trade payables (Rs.1.6 billion), Cost of Sales (Rs.688 million), and retained earnings (Rs.728 million). Related Party transactions with Hascol Lubricants (Pvt) Limited (Rs.3 billion for issuance of shares), Vitol Bahrain E.C. (Rs. 140 billion approx.), Hascol Terminals Ltd (Rs.1.6 billion approx.) during the period March 2019, June 2019 and September 2019. Non-disclosure of information pertaining to transfer of lubricating business to related party in the accounts for period ended June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2019. The operating expenses of the Company as per quarterly accounts for the quarter ended September 30, 2019 were Rs. 5.047 billion. In the annual accounts for the year ended December 31, 2019 the same reduced to Rs. 4.896 billion; and Distribution & Marketing and Administrative expenses decreased by Rs. 151.48 million. The Additional Director ACD framed the following issues saying that the matter is being referred to PLAD for soliciting expert opinion on following issues with specific reference to the court case and initiation of an inspection under section 221 of the Act:  (i) whether Order for inspection u/s 221 of the Act can be issued, keeping in view the fact that proceedings of SCN under section 257 of the Act are subjudice before the Court considering the following: (a)  SCN under section 257 of the Act was issued primarily for material misstatement in the first quarter accounts of the Company for the period ended March 31, 2019 reported in thehalf yearly accounts for the period ended June 30, 2019; and (b)  IRN has been issued by the offsite wing for initiation of inspection proceedings under section 221 of the Act on the basis of annual audited accounts of the Company for the financial year ended December 31, 2019. The financial year ended December 31, 2019 includes the quarters ended March 31, 2019 and the half yearly period ended June 30, 2019, which is subjudice before the Court in the investigation proceedings under section 257 of the Act. On July 13, 2021, SECP issued an official statement, saying that it took notice of Hascol's reported accounts for the period ending June 30, 2019 during October 2019. In this regard, the SECP has \"diligently\" followed its requisite internal protocols in compliance with its mandated role and responsibility. However, being the apex corporate regulator of the country, SECP has to conclude its proceedings after following due process as envisaged under the law. The SECP does not comment on its regulatory actions until they are finalized and orders are issued, at which stage they are published on its website without any exception. However, recently some \"misreporting\" in the print media has been undertaken that is devoid of facts and has been published without seeking SECP's version, the statement said.

The previous process was time and again blamed and criticized for being too cumbersome and rigid, with painstakingly long tender closure dates, and out-of-date pricing structure linked with crude oil prices. That has changed for the better, and the immediate impact is there for everyone to see. The latest LNG tender floated by the Pakistan LNG Limited saw much increased participation from bidders, with as much as 12 participants bidding for LNG supply for various windows between April to June. As much as eight participants bid for a June cargo, which is the most number of bidders for any cargo in the PLL tender history. What is also important is the time from the tender issuance to closure, which has reduced drastically, and increases chances of fetching prices closer to the spot rates. The fixed rate bidding also lessens the crude oil hedge exposure of the suppliers, which at times has cost Pakistan big time both in terms of value and the actual supply of RLNG. Comparisons with the long-term Qatar contract may start pouring in again as the delivered ex-ship (DES) LNG price for March and April is 7 percent and 25 percent expensive for the long-term contract versus the PLL imports. It must be noted that the very long-term Qatar contract came to the rescue for Pakistan in the peak demand winter season, where the DES price for PLL was an average 18 percent higher than PSO imports, for three months from December 2020 to February 2021. As crude oil prices have rallied in the past two months, the DES price for PSO imports for April 2021 will sit around $8.16/mmbtu, which is the highest since March 2020. Landed price for May 2021 is expected to be even higher, as the trailing three-month Brent crude average is considered to work out with the slope, and a price around $8.8.7/mmbtu is on the cards for May 2021. On the other hand, PLL cargoes till June 2021 have been arranged, and the DES price sits at a comfortable $6.7/mmbtu, which is very close to the spot rates observed in the Asian markets. The LNG global demand is also coming gradually back to pre-Covid levels. As per Bloomberg, March 2021 saw the highest increase in global LNG imports, as demand from Asian countries lead the way. Pakistan seems to have ironed out the LNG import procedure just in time.

He said that the SSGCL was facing 250 to 260 mmcfd gas deficit as demand peaked to 1,250 mmcfd against supply of 1015 mmcfd in the current month. The gas shortage in January 2022 would further increase to 280 mmcfd as demand would be around 1296 mmcfd and supply would be the same, he added.  He said that the general industry and captive power units did not honour obligations of their contracts, which allowed government to curtail gas for three months of winter, The RLNG volume also decreased to 75 mmcfd from 150 mmcfd available previous winter. In addition, he maintained the flow of indigenous gas to Karachi was also reduced by seven to eight percent. He further said that the SSGCL was supplying 200 mmcfd to Quetta as temperature there was in minus zone. An official of the Petroleum Division apprised the committee that in the LNG prices internationally were unprecedentedly high which reached $56 per mmcfd.

The government had budgeted no subsidy on gas supply and no mechanism to bill the end consumers, he added. He maintained that the Petroleum Division submitted a summary to the Finance Division to release some fund for both government entities (the PSO and the PLL). The chairman committee asked why the Petroleum Division did not arrange imported LNG after receiving demand for current winter. The additional secretary PD informed the committee that 80 percent LNG delivered via long-term agreement and 20 percent through spot purchase, as they could not ink agreements for the whole year when the demand fluctuated. Earlier, the official of the PD apprised the committee that circular debt to oil and gas sector reached Rs1.2 trillion and receivable of both gas companies were Rs500 billion for local gas and Rs300 billion for LNG. The MD Sui Northern Gas Pipeline Limited (SNGPL) informed the committee members that to ensure smooth supply of gas to the domestic sector, the gas to captive power plants, CNG outlets, cement, and also power sector was curtailed in Punjab. The chairman committee warned the Minister for Energy, Hammad Azhar, to submit requisition; in case, the minister would not attend the committee meeting. He was asked to come to committee meeting on several occasions, but he refused to attend the meeting. The members committee warned the management of the SNGPL that they would not tolerate, if unelected representative of the federal government inaugurated the gas development scheme in Punjab. The MD SNGPL replied that the gas company was following the guidelines of the Division in this respect. The Committee on the issue of incomplete and unfinished schemes of legislators expressed strong dissatisfaction over the answers given by the ministry. Saqib Rubab, an official of the SNGPL explained that Prime Minister Imran Khan constituted a committee to complete the gas schemes in various constituencies across the country after meeting with parliamentarians. The gas company had started working on ongoing development project of laying 5,000km long gas pipeline. Responding to a question regarding moratorium on new gas connections, he said that it was a temporary phase and in couple of weeks, the government would provide them guideline on new gas connections. The committee inquired from the OGRA chairman whether there is any political pressure on you regarding performing the official commitments; in response, he clarified categorically that there is no pressure over them and they were performing their duties as per rules and regulations.

While answering the committee regarding price hikes in petroleum products, the Petroleum Division officials stated that due to international rise in the prices we are constrained to raise prices in Pakistan.

This was stated by Minister for Information and Broadcasting Shibli Faraz and Minister for Planning, Development and Reforms Asad Umar, while speaking at a news conference after cabinet meeting presided over by Prime Minister Imran Khan on Tuesday.  Shibli Faraz said out of Rs403 billion, Rs122 billion was interest payment, Rs72 billion payment of the PSO or other suppliers companies.  \u201cThe breakdown of the remaining Rs1,300 billion is Rs700 billion of the IPPs and Rs600 billion of GENCOs,\u201d added the minister. The information minister said that agreements signed with the IPPs in the past were \u201cagainst the people and the country\u201d and the government was unable to get out of expensive contracts because of international obligations.  \u201cTherefore, the government decided to engage with IPPs to reach an understanding over a mechanism to get some concession [from IPPs] in capacity payments,\u201d said the minister adding that after prolong engagement and complex negotiations \u2013 without compromising either on forensic audit or anything else \u2013 reached an agreement on a limit (break) on dollar-rupee parity.\u201d He said capacity payment has increased from Rs650 billion last year to Rs850 billion this year because of addition of additional power in the system and more power would also be added to the system.  The government was worried about excessive and expensive electricity, he further stated.  The minister maintained that there would be saving of Rs836 billion over the next 20 years and tariffs of electricity would also be reduced after the agreement.  The government owed this money to the IPPs he said and added that the power sector circular debt has risen to over Rs2 trillion.   The Prime Minister\u2019s Office said the federal cabinet was informed that agreement with the IPPs would save Rs800 billion over the next 20 years and payment to the IPPs would be made after pre-audit.  The meeting was further informed that a high-level committee has been constituted comprising two judges of the Supreme Court and an auditor to look into the matter of over Rs57 billion that was highlighted in Muhammad Ali report.  The meeting was also informed that 12 IPPs have won the case of Rs92 billion and the government after negotiation saved Rs32 billion.     Shibli Faraz added that he would arrange a briefing of media with the people from the energy sector who were involved in this process of negotiations, so that they could respond to their questions in this regard.  The minister said that Pakistan power producers\u2019 rate of return has been converted in to rupee and foreign power producers\u2019 rate of return on equity has been reduced from 17 percent to 15 percent.  The federal cabinet allowed import of three lac tons wheat and five lac tons of sugar exemption of the PPRA rules. The minister added that the federal cabinet has also decided to assign the responsibility to monitor the prices of essential commodities in the market to the district administration (deputy commissioners and commissioners), and expecting the decision to yield positive results as price monitoring committees remained ineffective to monitor the prices of essential commodities.  Historically, he said district administration has been monitoring prices in the market.  The prime minister has also directed the tax authorities to tap alternate resources for revenue mobilisation such as taking action against smuggling of items as was in the case of petrol, cigarettes, etc, instead of burdening the people through indirect taxes. The cabinet meeting deliberated on the menace of smuggling, and noted that it was hurting the industry as well as economy and causing a loss to the revenue, he said.   The minister added that when there is a shortfall in revenue; the government imposes indirect taxes, which adversely impacts everyone.  He said that recently the Customs Department and the Federal Board of Revenue have effectively taken action against 2,192 petrol pumps involved in the sale of smuggled petrol which was causing Rs120 billion loss in terms of taxes.  The cabinet meeting also expressed concern over release of 32,000 metric tons six-year old wheat to the people of Karachi by the Sindh government, he said, adding that this release of old stock by the provincial government has endorsed the federal government\u2019s view point that the Sindh government was not releasing stock thereby creating wheat crisis in the country and forcing people to buy expensive wheat flour.   The minister said people of Karachi must raise their voice against it and this issue must also be raised in the Sindh Assembly. On implementation of the sugar report\u2019s proposed actions, he said that the delay in implementation was primarily due to vacating stay orders from courts.  The minister said that now the government is installing cameras in all sugar mills to know their actual stock position; (ii) the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) tax audit has improved Rs368 billion tax liabilities; (iii) the GST on sugar has increased by 60 to 65 percent increase - Rs29 billion; (iv) farmers were paid a good price of their cane crop; (v) the FIA detected Rs22 billion money laundering; (vi) inquiry is also being conducted on subsidy by the NAB. The prime minister gave one week for appointment of the CEOs/heads of public sector organisations after he was informed that there are 86 government entities without heads of the department.  The prime minister directed them to inform him about the reasons for not appointing their heads.  The prime minister said that there should be no unannounced load shedding in any part of the country.  The federal cabinet gave approval to the establishment of 30 accountability courts in various cities including Karachi, Lahore, Multan, Peshawar, Hyderabad, Rawalpindi, Sukkur, and Quetta.  The federal government gave approval to the appointment of Masroor Khan as chairman Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra). The meeting gave extension in the Afghanistan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement (APTTA) for the next three months  The cabinet appreciated the State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s initiative of Roshan Digital Pakistan as so far, overseas Pakistanis have remitted $500 million, and it gave approval to the tax amendment ordinance 2021 to facilitate investment in the Roshan Digital Pakistan project, the minister said.  The meeting was also given a briefing by the IT task force for the promotion of IT in the country. Federal Minister for Planning Asad Umar said the government wants to end the corrupt practice of horse trading from the Senate elections, and that is why it approached the apex court for seeking its guidance and issued an ordinance for holding election of senators through show of hands.  The minister regretted that the opposition has opposed the bill and was now making a hue and cry.  About a video clip circulating on media, he said it is imperative to acknowledge the importance of the Senate election reforms again.  He said: \u201cdemocracy works when people sitting in the assemblies are trusted by the people who voted them in.\u201d The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), he said, started the process from \u201cChanga Manga\u201d and it is persisting with that approach to politics even today.  He said the Senate amendment being introduced today only goes against those who use their power and money to influence election process.  He said, \u201cwe approached the SC regarding the Senate polls, but thought of introducing the presidential ordinance since Supreme Court is yet to rule on the matter and the Senate election date is nearing.\u201d He further reiterated the PTI's stance that the party will accept apex court\u2019s ruling on the matter. APP adds: Talking about the Sugar Commission report, minister said the government won the cases filed by the sugar mafia in different provinces.  As per the report, under an action matrix the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) had pointed out tax liabilities of Rs 368 billion, general sales tax on sugar increased by 60 to 65 percent or Rs 29 billion, and the farmers received good timely payments.  He said the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) had unearthed Rs 22 billion of money laundering.  Implementation of the sugar report was delayed due to court cases, he said, adding now cameras were being installed in the sugar mills to ascertain the actual position of stocks.  He said in the past sugar prices were manipulated by the mafias. The government was working against the mafias but action against them also got delayed as those people got together for their vested interests.

In January 2021, M/s Byco Petroleum Pakistan Limited conducted groundbreaking on a project named \u201cupgrade \u2013 1\u201d.  Pakistan\u2019s fuel mix has evolved rapidly in the past four years. Till mid-2017, furnace oil or fuel oil was the main feedstock for power plants. This was switched overnight to LNG in October 2017 on the instructions of the then government. Suddenly, hydro-skimming refineries had no market left for fuel oil, and were at pains to store it.  A byproduct of making gasoline, diesel and other outputs of hydro-skimming, furnace oil was even exported by Byco to lessen financial losses incurred on it. The plant will clean the diesel and gasoline down to 10 ppm (parts- per million) of Sulphur to comply with Euro-5/6 standards.  Talking to a group of reporters, Chairman Byco\u2019s Petroleum Pakistan Limited said that Byco has started civil work and delivery of equipment has also been initiated.  M/s Byco Petroleum Pakistan Limited has changed its name to Cinergyco PK Limited and also replaced the fund managers M/s Abraaj Capital by an investors group.  The Chairman further revealed that the first name of the refinery was Bosicor which was changed to Byco due to M/s Abraaj Capital which was not funding the project but was running a fund as portfolio manager. The Infrastructure Growth Capital Fund (IGCF) had given the management of the fund to M/s Abraaj Investment Management Limited (AIML) who established a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) which was registered in Mauritius under the name of Abraaj Mauritius Oil and Gas (AMOG) with shareholding with M/s Bosicor after which it became Byco Corporation .  When liquidation of Abraaj started, the IGCF Board got away with AIML, with the argument that M/s Abraaj's name should not be mentioned. The IGCF then handed over the management of the fund to another company \u2013 AM - which is now fund manager of IGCF.  The same 27-28 shareholders of Byco, are also the shareholders of Karachi Electric (KE). \"Now Abraaj is out from Byco and the new company IGCF has taken over,\" he maintained.  As per our planned schedule Byco has commenced civil works for the installation of our DHDS and FCC units. The addition of the DHDS and FCC facilities to our refining complex will enable Byco to produce Euro 5 | Euro 6 compliant diesel and gasoline in Pakistan as per the government\u2019s directive. The upgrade will enable Byco to reduce production of low value Furnace Oil and enhance our products\u2019 quality, making them better for the environment as well as more valuable for our business and thereby will boost Byco\u2019s profitability,\u201d he added.  The government is currently working on new oil refinery policy that offers incentives for existing up-gradation projects and new refineries as well.  The Chairman said that the proposed refinery was good so far as refineries are concerned which are operating now in negative margins due to lower prices of refined products.  He urged the government to approve incentives for up-gradation of existing plants.  Wasi Khan said that Byco\u2019s upgrade project and conversion plant would be completed in 2024.  \u201cWe considered that global oil industry will peak in 2030 but it has witnessed its peak time now,\u201d he said, adding that it has started to go down now following other energy resources. The oil prices stood at $100 per barrel before the pandemic but have hardly touched $70 per barrel mark now.  He said that there had been an expansion in EV and solar energy therefore oil consumption is going down now but there will be a market for jet fuel, petro chemical and lubricants. Heavy vehicles will continue using oil as it would be difficult for them to operate on electricity.  About oil consumption growth in Pakistan, he said that oil industry had predicted 30 million tons but at present it stands at 20-22 million tons which is below projections.  He said that market of furnace oil had ended now and maritime industry has been using furnace oil but diesel oil was going to replace it. However, there will be no immediate phasing out of jet fuel and petrochemicals. He further said that hydrogen will remain.  Refineries will have to adjust to the market and as hydrogen will largely remain refineries will have to convert to produce hydrogen, Wasi Khan said.  At present, there are controlled regulations in oil prices. The oil industry had to follow the import parity price of Pakistan State Oil (PSO) which now is pegged to PLATTS price. At present, the prices of refined products are lower compared to crude oil with a difference of $2 to $6 that has put the refineries in negative margins.  Khan said that the government should come out of the business of regulating oil prices. He proposed deregulating oil prices. Byco is the first refinery in Pakistan that has set up Single Point Mooring (SPM), a floating liquid port in deep sea for crude oil shipments. It handles 12 million metric tons per year oil imports. He said that Byco also planned to set up additional SPM 2 and SPM 3. At present, Byco refinery is operating at 60 percent due to higher production of furnace oil. With conversion plant, the production of refinery would go up to 100 percent.

The downstream oil and gas sector has seen significant fluctuation in demand the last few years due to COVID. Other factors steering demand of petroleum products have been the changes in the energy mix particularly shifting away from the furnace oil towards coal and LNG; and then the comeback of furnace oil during COVID and post COVID times due to the systemic issues in the refining system as well as the rise in demand from the power sector. As the industry leader, PSO has been driving trends in the sector. In FY17 PSO witnessed a growth of 8 percent in compared to a growth ranging from -9 percent to 4 percent in the previous six fiscal years. Rise in volumes along with higher prices and the RLNG business led to 30 percent year-on-year surge in the PSO\u2019s sales revenues and 77 percent growth in the bottomline. Volumetric growth continued in FY18 in retail segment, especially motor spirit and HSD. However, PSO\u2019s furnace oil volumes declined by 29.6 percent year-on-year in FY18 as energy mix shifted to RLNG and coal for the power sector. While topline was up by 20 percent, profit after tax went down by 15.2 percent year-on-year primarily on account of one-time reversal of deferred tax asset; falling other income and higher exchange losses. FY19 was a difficult year for the OMCs due to economic slowdown amid rising competition. Margins also fell due to falling volumes by the sector especially the furnace oil, while the retail fuels like diesel volumes also witnessed a decline due to falling demand from both the industrial sector, and the transport sector along with falling vehicle sales. Moreover, the high interest rate environment along with exchange losses, peaking circular debt and mounting receivables were key factors that dragged the sectors performance including that of PSO. And despite an overall decline of around 38 percent in volumetric sales, PSO\u2019s revenues posted modest increase due to a rebound in the the company\u2019s volumes in the last quarter of FY19. Profits slipped by 32 percent, which came from higher inventory losses as well as lower volumes, finance cost and exchange losses. In FY19, PSO acquired 52.67 percent stake in PRL, which lifted its consolidated earnings. In FY20, PSO\u2019s volumes in furnace oil reduced further due to the continuing impact of focus on RLNG. On the other hand, in the retail sector PSO experienced an increase in petrol volumes against an overall decline in the industry due to PSO\u2019s increased assortment amid low demand. Industry diesel volumes too were affected due to weak industrial activity, construction activity, and reduced road and rail movement. However, PSO managed to gain volumetric growth. Decline in gross profit for PSO was mainly due to inventory losses besides the falling volumes on account of sharp decrease in international oil prices during the year. However, increase in finance cost due to higher average policy rate adversely impacted the bottomline. Decline in gross profit and increase in finance cost was partially offset by lower exchange losses and higher interest income recovered from power sector during the year. PSO reported record earnings for FY21 with a rebound in profitability that comes in contrast to a loss in FY20. PSO was able to reverse the trend of falling revenues with FY21 topline growing by 9 percent year-on-year due to volumetric growth and price increase. A key feature for FY21 was the return of furnace oil in the fuel mix as its demand and usage increased during the year. PSO\u2019s overall volumes increased by 24 percent year-on-year with the three key products: petrol, diesel and furnace oil climbing by 21, 21, and 37 percent year-on-year. This also resulted in the rise of market share for PSO from 44.3 percent in FY20 to 46.3 percent in FY21. The while oil segment touched the highest ever volumes despite the shrinking jet fuel industry where PSO\u2019s market share rose again from 44 percent in FY20 to 45 percent in FY21. PSO\u2019s market share in petrol increased from 38.7 percent in FY20 to 41.3 percent in FY21. Its diesel (HSD) market share increased by 140 basis points to 47.2 percent. Its market share for FO grew from 46 percent to almost 52 percent in FY21. PSO\u2019s volumetric sales growth is partially attributed to upgraded fuel quality; PSO introduced Euro 5 standard petrol, diesel and HOBC during the year. During the year, the company commenced it first EV charging facility in Islamabad and focused on infrastructure as well as technological development where it increased storage capacity, retail presence etc. PSO\u2019s earnings benefitted from increase in other income that comes from growth in late payment surcharge income; no noticeable rise in administrative and distribution costs; and a decline in finance cost due to weaker interest rates. PSO continued to win at the volumetric front. During the first quarter of FY22, oil sales were above 5.8 million tons growing by 24 percent year-on-year and led by double-digit growth in furnace oil HSD and MS. PSO\u2019s growth in volumes surpassed industry growth with a growth rate of 34 percent year-on-year. Higher volumetric growth was drove PSO\u2019s topline with FO contributing the most to the growth in volumes followed by HSD and MS, respectively. PSO\u2019s topline was up by a massive 64 percent year-on-year and besides the volumetric incline, the jump in the OMC\u2019s sales was also due to the surge in petroleum prices. The OMC reported all-time high profits for a quarter in 1QFY22 where apart from the topline growth, inventory gains and jump in gross profits were also the factors driving earnings growth. It benefitted from inventory gains during the quarter due to the jump in retail product prices amid rising global crude oil prices. Despite the rise in other expenses and distribution and marketing expenses, PSO\u2019s operating profits more than doubled with support from other income. Further support to the bottomline came from lower finance costs on account of lower short term borrowings. PSO\u2019s earnings surged by more than 2.3 times in 1QFY22 where much of the volumetric growth came from reviving consumption and demand of petroleum products, price increase as well as the company\u2019s increased retail footprint and up gradation in fuel quality. And the same will continue to be the growth drivers for the coming quarters. However, where rising oil price is benefiting the OMC in terms of inventory gains, a long term increase in oil prices can impact the liquidity position of the company via high working capital requirement and circular debt build-up.

The copy of letter has also been sent to Secretary Petroleum and other relevant authorities. PSO\u2019s letter is with reference to the Court Orders of June 29, 2022 passed by the Lahore High Court in pursuance of the two separate PPA Amendment Agreements both of April 20, 2021 executed between Central Power Purchasing Agency- Guaranteed (CPPA-G), Pakgen Power Ltd. (Pakgen) and Lalpir Power Ltd. (Lalpir), respectively. Both the IPPs and CPPA-G are parties to these agreements. PSO maintains that upon review of the PPA Amendment Agreements, it appears that the parties have mutually agreed to allow IPPs to procure fuel from other OMCs as well. According to PSO, PPA Amendment Agreements have been executed between the parties pursuant to the award of December 18, 2020 passed through arbitration conducted under the International Chamber of Commerce Rules of Arbitration, in favour of the IPPs, declaring inter-alia that there is no obligation on the IPPs to purchase residual fuel oil from PSO alone. PSO has highlighted that earlier the Govt. of Pakistan (GoP) entered into separate Implementation Agreements with the IPPs of September 24, 1994 (Implementation Agreements) whereby PSO was declared as a sole fuel supplier to IPPs. In terms of the Implementation Agreements, Power Purchase Agreements were executed between Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) and Pakgen and Lalpir on September 05, 1995 and November 03, 1994, respectively whereby PSO was defined as a sole fuel supplier to the IPPs. The state-owned fuel supply company has maintained that based on the exclusivity given to it as a sole fuel supplier, Pakgen and Lalpir entered into the Fuel Supply Agreements on September 07, 1995 & November 06, 1994, respectively, with PSO in terms whereof the IPPs have to purchase fuel, diesel oil, lubricants, and greases from PSO. PSO has further argued that the IAs, PPAs and the FSA are inter-linked with each other forming part of a complete supply arrangement. Accordingly, the FSAs are interlocked with the PPAs. Thus the amendment/ decision related to one agreement would lead to corresponding impact/ changes in the other agreements, as well. Therefore, PSO being one of the key parties and stakeholder of the said supply arrangement should have been engaged, informed and taken into the loop of the amendments made in the PPAs through PPA amendment agreements. The fuel supplier said that in terms of the FSAs, PSO has made huge investments, particularly in terms of fuel oil storages, operational facilities and logistic to ensure timely fuel oil supplies to the IPPs as per the requirement forwarded by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) and the monthly forecast given by the IPPs irrespective of the operation of the plants. \u201cPSO has to maintain the stocks inventories and facilities in order to make the fuel oil supplies available to the IPPs as per terms of the FSAs despite low/ non-upliftment by the IPPs. Therefore, the amendment in the PPAs through PPA IA is directly affecting PSO\u2019s investments and the company is incurring significant losses due to low/ non-upliftment of fuel oil by IPPs against their entire fuel oil demand,\u201d said, Ghulam Murtaza Shaikh. After explaining the entire scenario, he has requested CPPA-G to understand its position and take appropriate measures so that the IPPs should be encouraged to uplift their entire fuel requirements from PSO.

Meanwhile, National Power Control Centre (NPCC) has conveyed to Petroleum Division that RLNG of 396 MMCFD has been allocated for October 2022 against demand of 750 MMCFD. For October, total requirement of furnace oil for 11 power plants is 273263 MT of which HSFO demand is 237729 MTs whereas LSFO demand is 35534 MTs. According to NPCC, two hour load management is considered as per direction of MoE (Power Division ). NPCC argued that generation shortfall will further increase in case of non-supply of fuel and any other unforeseen event. \u201cThese are tentative average figures. Variation in consumption may be observed, as actual system dispatch will depend on plant availability, system demand, Economic Merit Order (EMO) and availability of network,\u201d said Sajjad Akhtar GM NPCC in a letter to Petroleum Division and its attached Organizations. He further stated that apart from the operational requirement fuel-oil at various power plants, the fuel oil stock consumed must be replenished by consistent/ cyclic building-up of oil stock at all oil-based  power plants in accordance with their relevant PPA, so that system requirement could be met and any power shortfall due to fuel shortage could be avoided. GM NPCC has also urged CPPA-G that necessary payments to power plants must be ensured for timely procurement of fuel to avoid shortage of fuel constraint and load management. He maintained that any additional RLNG made available to power sector will be utilized according to the prevailing ECO as and when allocated. However, variations in RLNG supply to power sector from already committed supply will cause variation in consumption of FRO/ HSD.

Net sales for 9MFY22 at Rs1.55 billion were highest ever and even more than the annual sales in the company\u2019s history. Growth in volumes stood at around 24 percent for 9MFY22 where the three key fuels: furnace oil, diesel and petrol were up by 22 percent, 26 percent, and 16 percent respectively. Similarly, the growth key fuels for 3QFY22 were also in double digits - playing an instrumental role in lifting the topline of the OMC. Noticeable growth in volumes also helped PSO grow its market share in all the three products. Also high oil prices during the period helped PSO grow its topline. But the growth in topline was not the only factor pushing up gross margins for PSO in 9MFY22. The OMC incurred colossal inventory gains on the back of higher oil prices, which supplemented the lift in gross margins from 6.04 percent in 9MFY21 to 7.73 percent in 9MFY22. On the expenses side, the distribution and marketing expenses remained lower. PSO\u2019s operating profits grew by more than 3x in 9MFY22 with support from other income as well as the topline and gross profit growth. Finance cost however was also seen growing during the period due to higher interest rates and increase in short term borrowings, while other income growth was massive due to interest income on late payment. PSO\u2019s bottom-line surged by more than 3.7 times in 9MFY22 where much of the growth came from volumetric growth and inventory gains, reviving consumption and demand of petroleum products, price increase, higher other income as well as the company\u2019s increased retail footprint and up gradation in fuel quality.

However, the actual upliftment by the power plants has been significantly less in comparison to Power Division demand, as well as, customer demand during this period. During this period, only 545,000 MTS product has been uplifted from PSO against supply plan of 1,044,000 MTs with shortfall of approx. 400,000 MTs whereas Power Division demand for this period was 1,406,000 MTs. As a result, PSO has been facing severe ullage issues to offload its cargoes causing excessive demurrages and upliftment from refineries has also been badly affected in addition to the cash flow issues faced by PSO. The sources said in the view of demand and upliftment scenario and the demand received from Power Division and customers, PSO has also firmed up its supply plan for the month of September, 2022. Based on available fuel oil stock, local refinery avails and previously awarded two HSFO cargoes (deferred from August first fortnight to end of August and September first fortnight respectively) PSO has not awarded any additional HSFO or LSFO cargoes for the month of September, 2022.  Based on the existing considerable variance in demand vs upliftment during this period, PSO has requested to revisit the plant wise RFO requirement shared for the month of October, 2022 in its letter of August 25, 2022. \u201cPSO has sought response / update from Power Division in this matter for RFO requirement with plant-wise break-up for Nov 22 \u2013 Dec 22, enabling PSO to firm up its supply plan accordingly keeping in view of import cycle of minimum 60 days. Accordingly, PSO\u2019s tentative HSFO/ LSFO supply plan September, 2022 for its contractual customers is as follows: Hubco\u2019s demand was 80,000 MT whereas Power Division demand was 10,910 MT which is being met. The demand from Lalpir/ Pakgen was 58,000 MT against demand of 71,400 MT of Power Division; however, PSO will supply 58,000 MT. Furnace oil demand of Kohinoor Energy was 9,000 MT whereas Power Division forwarded demand of 16,374 MT. PSO has met demand submitted by the power plant (customer). PSO will supply 5,000 MT to Muzaffargarh (Genco III) and 10,000 MT to Jamshoro (Genco 1). Of the PSO\u2019s non-contractual customers, Saba Power is receiving 8,000 MT against Power Division\u2019s demand of 4,200 MT, Liberty Power Tech Limited, 5,000 MT against Power Division demand of 20,663 MT, Nishat Power Chunian, 6,000 MT verses 21,276 MT demand forwarded by Power Division, Nishat Power Limited 5,000 MT against Power Division\u2019s demand of 18,673 MT.  The sources maintained that total demand of HSFO placed by customers was 181,000 MT, against Power Division demand of 163,000, whereas PSO will supply 116,916 MT. The demand from Kot Addu Power Plant (KAPCO) was 140,000 MT whereas PSO will supply 60,000 MT despite demand of 44,850 MT placed by Power Division. KAPCO cancelled cargoes of first and second fortnight for the month of September.  Total demand of PSO\u2019s RFO was 321,000 MT for September whereas PSO will supply 176,916 MT against demand of 208,352 MT placed by the Power Division. PSO only supplied approximately 91,661 MTs against the revised supply plan of approximate 188,164 MTs with a shortfall of approximate 96,503 MTs during the month of August, 2022 due to upliftment/ order placement and delay in payments from various power plants. As a result, PSO has been facing ullage constraints to offload its cargoes, and upliftment from refineries was also affected.  PSO maintains that tentative supply plan for September is subject to timely payment or orders from respective Genco\u2019s/ IPPs. Any deviation from this will affect supplies to customers.  PSO maintains that customers receipt may vary from daily plan due to transit time. Supplies from Karachi have 2-3 day transmit time.

Sources said that the ECC was informed that PSO\u2019s receivables have increased to Rs. 608 billion as of 28.07.2022. A major contributing factor to this is LNG supply which has added a cash shortfall of Rs 213 billion since July 1, 2021, making the total LNG receivables to Rs. 339 billion. On the other hand SNGPL is constrained by delayed payments by Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPAG) and its receivables have increased to Rs 113 billion from Rs 43 billion on 1st January 2022.   The direct receivables of PSO from CPPAG stood at Rs.182 billion, out of which Rs.16 billion have accumulated since 1st July 2022. Delay in payments to PSO by respective entities has sapped the liquidity of PSO. As a result of this, the company has not been able to deposit Rs. 80.7 billion to government NIDA account for onward transmission to Kuwait Petroleum Cooperation (KPC), which is a contractual obligation for PSOCL/ GOP. In addition, the PSO has not been able to deposit Rs 16 billion to government under ITFC facility. These payments to government have been deferred by PSO so that it does not default on its international contractual obligations.  The meeting was further informed that decline of sales of HSD and MS for PSO by 28% and 32%, respectively, had an impact of Rs. 69 billion on collections, whereas devaluation of the Rs against US$ (17.8% in July 2022) has resulted in increased cost of procurement of these products by PSO by Rs.63 billion.  The receivables from government against this exchange loss stood at Rs 54.6 billion and although PSO in spite of these challenges has met its contractual international payments in July, 2022 but from 1st August, this will not be possible and consequently there will be disruption of the national oil and gas supply chain in LNG and petroleum products.   PSO has to make an international payment of Rs.267 billion in the first fortnight of August 2022. The forecasted collection of PSO during the first fortnight of August 2022 is Rs. 157 billion resulting in a net deficit of Rs 100 billion (Deficit of Rs. 80 billion 1-14 August 2022 and Rs. 20 billion 15-28 August 2022).  Therefore, in order to ensure that PSO does not default on international payments and that the oil and gas national supply chain is not disrupted, it is proposed that: (a) PSO receivables from government against exchange loss of Rs.54.6 billion may be released immediately;(b) for the remaining amount of Rs 54.4 billion, direction may be issued t the NBP and other banks to extend the credit limits for PSO on an emergency basis;(c) power division may be directed to make immediate payments of the current outstanding amount of Rs 12.8 billion  against furnace oil and at least Rs 20 billion against RLNG supplies by 2nd August.  The meeting, for the smooth continuity of oil and gas national supply chain and avoid PSO from being default on international payments, has decided to clear the outstanding payments accumulated during the period of pervious government and approved an amount of Rs 30 billion as supplementary grant for PSO receivables.  The meeting also decided that Power Division would make immediate payments of the current outstanding amounts of Rs 20 billion by 1st August, 2022 and Rs. 12.8 billion by 4th August, 2022. The ECC also directed Finance Division and FBR to submit proposal for generation of Rs. 30 billion through taxes, within a week.

PSO says that in the event Qatar Gas accepts upward flexible cargoes, PSO cannot cancel such cargo once exercised during that year. All the additional cargoes will become part of the annual contractual quantity attracting take or pay clause of the agreement. According to the Annual Upward Flexibility Quantity (AUFQ), in 2014, four cargoes of 12,800,000 MMBTU of LNG were imported, followed by one cargo of 3,200,000 MMBTU and one cargo of 3,050,000 MMBTU in 2021. However, in 2020, one cargo of 2,872,800 MMBTU was also imported under Annual Downward Flexibility Quantity (ADFQ).  During Sep-21 PSO exercised its option for 5 additional cargoes under both contracts upward flexibility clause during CY 2022. However, Qatar Gas has declined PSO\u2019s request on the basis of delivery capacity limitations. According to the contract PSO can again request for additional cargoes from time to time subject to 90 days\u2019 advance notice and Qatar Gas can consider the same request on case to case basis subject to available operational/ delivery capacity. Considering non-obligatory option on part of Qatar Gas coupled with current market scenario, additional product availability situation remains uncertain. Excess seller LNG and other provision of the agreement: - In case PSO desires to purchase LNG in excess of the existing contractual under both agreements, it may notify Qatar Gas the quantity of excess LNG required under the terms and conditions of these agreements. Qatar Gas, at its sole discretion, shall accept or decline to offer to sell such excess LNG quantity to the buyer within 30 days from the date of receipts such request. Under the provision of \u201cexcess seller LNG\u201d, if the parties so agree, the excess seller LNG shall be added to the ACQ of each subsequent contract year during the course of the agreement. According to clause 28.2 of the pact, the agreement may not be amended, modified, varied or supplemented unless agreed by the parties in writing. However, clause 28.3 says no waiver is implied. The failure of either party to require the performance of any provision of the agreement shall not affect its right to require future performance pursuant to such provision.  The rights of a party shall not be prejudiced or affected by any delay for forbearance which it might allow or show in enforcing the same. Performance of any condition or obligation to be performed hereunder shall not be deemed to have been waived or postponed except by an instrument in writing signed by the party who is claimed to have granted such waiver or postponement. Contract Price Review: Under both contracts either party may give a notice (price review notice) to the other party to renegotiate the contract price in March 2026; however, no review of contractual quantity is available.  Subsequent to the price review notice, the parties shall meet in good faith and discuss the matter with a view to agreeing what price adjustment (if any) is required. If the parties agree on the price revision same shall apply from the review date pursuant to clause 15.2.5 &15.2.6(e) for first and second agreements respectively. Once the price negotiation is exercised neither party is entitled to give a further price review notice to the other party till the end of contract. In case the parties have not agreed on price adjustment, within a period of six months from notice issued, either party may terminate first agreement upon giving notice to other party and such shall come into effect at the end of that contract year. However, second agreement instead of termination provides referring the matter to arbitration.  PSO will explain that during the price review period all supplies will be priced on a provisional basis under the formula prevailing prior to the price adjustment and subsequently adjusted and reimbursed together with the interest for such deliveries and paid by the party from which it is due.  The agreement shall remain in full force in case parties have not reached an agreement on price adjustment, unless and until terminated (in case of first agreement). PSO is of the view that considering all provisions of the agreements and associated limitation/ implication, the best option for securing additional supplies would be through requesting Qatar Gas for early ramp up under the second agreement from July22 instead of July 24 as this will add one cargo per month from July 22.

The chairman committee lamented the fact that PARCO and Attock oil refineries do not supply diesel and all the onus is on the PSO for the supply of diesel. The chairman committee recommended sharing the burden of PSO for the supply of diesel and taking practical steps to resolve the issue of the shortage of high speed diesel as the harvesting season is fast approaching.  The ministry officials apprised the committee that in order to avert any shortage in the market it needs to give confidence to the OMCs that the price differential shall be promptly paid. The committee was also informed that expected PDC for 1-15th March is Rs883 million rupees; however, in subsequent fortnights it is expected to be around Rs30 billion rupees depending upon international oil prices. The committee observed the government is giving Rs20-22 billion in the shape of cross subsidy annually. 19 percent gas consumption by fertilisers and 21percent gas by the Power Division is also consumed annually. The committee received a comprehensive briefing from the Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division) on the government\u2019s strategy and plans to handle the oil import and prices in the current scenario of Russia-Ukraine Conflict.  The Committee was apprised that the prime minister announced a relief package on 28th February 2022. There will be a reduction in the consumer price of Motor Spirit (MS) and High Speed Diesel (HSD) by Rs10 per litre. It has also been committed to keep the prices stable till the end of the fiscal year. Petroleum Levy will be Rs1.81/liter on Motor Spirit and zero on HSD.

The committee was informed that sales prices are not proportionally revised, resulting in rising differential.  The increasing domestic gas consumer\u2019s share resulted in lower cross subsidisation by higher paying sectors. The ministry briefed that circular debt (CD) is the outcome of policy choices by the GoP through sub-optimal cross subsidization. The GoP cannot keep both industry and domestic sector happy at the same time. The chairman committee proposed recommendations that the CNG import should be allowed by either the PLL or the CNG private stakeholders, themselves, rather than the government through the process of diversions, so that the burden on the government in the supply of gas can be shared and the issue of circular debt can also be resolved. The committee was also briefed on the reasons for reduction in PLL\u2019s Quantum of LNG imports including the unprecedented high spot market prices.  The committee was briefed that the PPL received approximately 143 billion rupees. Other reasons include problems related to credit security limitations and non-supply by term suppliers, the ministry informed. Senate Committee on Petroleum took up the issue of provision of gas facility to Sirikot, Tehsil Ghazi, district Haripur. The committee was informed that supply of gas to union council Sirikot was approved by the federal cabinet and the required government funding (direct) was credited in Assignment Account during 2018, but the work on the project could not commence in wake of general elections and the funds lapsed by the end of the financial year.  The fresh cost is estimated for supply of gas to union council Sirikot, District Haripur based on unit construction cost at 1,607.285 million rupees. The ministry informed that the government is reviewing expansion in domestic sector, improvement in gas supplies and removal of pricing distortion.   Matters pertaining to the oil and gas fields, wherein, section-4 has not been imposed, and details of acquisition of land and rent being paid to the land owners in Balochistan were presented.  Senator Sabir Shah raised question as to how can any private individual who does not legally own any land is charging rent to a state-owned firm.  The committee was briefed that in Balochistan, all land acquisition by Mari Petroleum Company Limited (MPCL) for its projects is done under section 161 of Balochistan Land Revenue Act, 1967 and that there is no land directly leased to landowners.  The chairman committee directed that chief secretaries be summoned on the issue and the concerned deputy commissioners should brief the committee on the matter. The issue of gas load-shedding, licensing and non\u2013establishment of LPG plants in Panjgur, raised by Senator Danesh Kumar was considered in detail.  The committee was apprised that there is no ban on construction/ installation of LPG plants all over Pakistan and licenses are being granted, to each and every applicant who fulfils requirement of Mineral and Industrial Gases Safety Rules, 2010.  The committee was also briefed that the SSGCL is trying its level best to serve all its consumers to the best of its ability prioritizing domestic sector despite, depletion in indigenous gas supplies by nine pc per annum.  The committee was also informed that the Economic Coordination Committee of the Cabinet (ECC) on 26th March 2020 had decided to shelve the installation of all LPG Air Mix Plants including the one in Panjgur.

However, since May 2022, KE has started to default in making timely payments to SSGC against weekly RLNG bills.   DG (Gas), Abdul Rasheed Jokhio, in a letter to Secretary Power Division, stated that due to financial constraints owing to delay in payment of RLNG bills by KE and in order to meet commitments with SNGPL, SSGC proceeded with encashment of bank guarantee provided by KE as Security Deposit to mitigate adverse financial implications to RLNG supply chain and international default by the LNG buyers namely PSO & PLL. However, KE obtained stay against encashment.   He maintained that SSGC has been in continuous communication with KE pursuing payment of outstanding dues but KE is associating its default in payment of RLNG over dues with non-receipt of Tariff Differential Subsidy (TDS) from the Federal Government.   In this regard, SSGC apprised that KE default as of August 01, 2022 has reached Rs26 billion (including LPS of Rs900 million) leading to a situation beyond SSGCs control whereby SSGC will be constrained to gradually reduce gas supplies to KE. DG (Gas) has requested the Power Division to take appropriate measure for release of TDS against the claim raised by KE enabling KE to clear its dues.   According to KE, its TDS claims for April to June 2022 were Rs56.4 billion which have been sent to Power Division, requesting the latter to notify them along with pending determinations as significant amount of TDS is stuck up due to pending notifications of the Schedule of Tariffs (SoTs), consequently impacting the working capital position of the company.   On July 27, 2022, in a letter to Secretary Petroleum, Ali Reza Bhutta, Managing Director SSGCL, Imran Maniar shared previous correspondence with KE and Petroleum Division, in which SSGC noted KE\u2019s continued default in making RLNG bill payment to SSGC and subsequently obtained a Stay Order from Sindh High Court against encashment of Bank guarantees.   Petroleum Division was informed that Moonis Alvi, CEO, KE visited SSGC offices on July 22, 2022 and held a meeting with SSGC management in which KE assured the gas utility company that it would release Rs5 billion plus Rs2 billion against RLNG bill payment during the current week, to maintain overdue amount at Rs18 billion, and will be paying current bills, subsequently.   He also requested for increase in indigenous gas supplies from 10 mmcfd to 20 mmcfd, which is not possible for SSGC with current indigenous gas supply numbers. However, SSGC had not received payment.   In case KE honours its commitment, and SSGC receives Rs. 7 billion from KE, the SSGC receivables would be reduced to the level of Rs18 billion.   For clearance of remaining receivable of Rs18 billion, SSGC management requires Petroleum Division\u2019s intervention to take up the subject matter with Ministry of Finance and ECC for early resolution of KE Tariff Differential Subsidy (TDS).   SSGCL argued that release of KE subsidy would enable KE to clear its dues to SSGCL which would be paid to SNGPL for onward remittance to PSO to save it from international default. MD, SSGC said that Petroleum Division is well aware of the fact that SSGCL is severely trapped in circular debt crisis. Moreover, liquidity issues including non-receipt of payment from industrial consumers like KE has severely affected RLNG supply chain and its effects are so severe that PSO is on the verge of international default and only KE\u2019s timely payment can resolve this grave issue.

The BAP senator sought from the Petroleum Division the details of net profit earned by the public sector petroleum companies, operating in Pakistan, during FY 2020-21, during question hour in the Senate. In reply to another question posed by Kumar regarding storage capacity of private and public sector petroleum companies in the country, the petroleum state minister said, the private and public sector companies\u2019 existing capacity regarding petrol storage was 662,198 metric tonnes for petrol and 907,178 metric tonnes for diesel. He added, as per prevailing policy of the federal government and licensing conditions of OGRA, every oil marketing company (OMC) is required to construct/ develop minimum storage of 20 days of its proposed sales, and to ensure to maintain the requisite stocks to meet its requirements across the country. Accordingly, OMCs have added 343,774 tonnes of petrol and diesel storage during last three years in the country without any government funds, the minster\u2019s reply stated. In response to a question by Behramand Tangi from Pakistan People\u2019s Party (PPP) regarding decrease in Chinese investment in Pakistan in the last two years, Investment Minister Salik Hussain admitted that Chinese investment in Pakistan decreased by 29.27 percent in FY 2021-22 and 2020-21 mainly due to Covid-19. China\u2019s foreign direct investment (FDI) in Pakistan was recorded $531.6 million in FY 2021-22, $751.6 million in FY 2020-21 and $846.6 million in FY 2019-20, he stated in written reply.

The ECC was told that a consortium of banks was formed that included ABL, NBP, MCB, UBL, and HBL for sanctioning a loan amounting to Rs50 billion to the PSO through a government guarantee. As the issuance of guarantee will take time, the banks have shown their willingness to initiate the process of issuing loan on letter of comfort. The ECC has approved the proposal to issue a letter of comfort in favour of the PSO for raising a loan facility of Rs50 billion on an urgent basis. However, the Finance Division was asked to divert some other allocated guarantees to PSO without exceeding Rs105 billion domestic guarantee limit for the 1st quarter of the current fiscal year. The ECC also gave approval of the government guarantee for the financing facility of $142 million as loan in accordance with the facility agreement between Roosevelt Hotel Corporation (RHC) and the National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) on a summary moved by the Ministry of Aviation. The Aviation Ministry sought the issuance of a government guarantee in favour of the NBP. The ECC meeting was further informed that as the hotel business had slowed down in the US and around the world due to the Covid-19 pandemic; therefore, the RHC was shut down in December 2020 to avoid losses. A committee headed by the deputy chairman Planning Commission was constituted to look into the financial challenges of the RHC. The ECC, on 2nd September 2020 had approved government support of $142 million on the recommendation of the committee. The Finance Division arranged a financing facility as loan from the NBP. The ECC after discussion approved a government guarantee for the financing facility of $142 million as a loan in accordance with a facility agreement between Roosevelt Hotel Corporation (RHC) and the National Bank of Pakistan (NBP). The Ministry of Industries and Production tabled a summary for revision of the price of imported urea and stated that the price of imported urea stored in National Fertiliser Marketing Limited (NFML) warehouses is lower than the locally-manufactured urea. In order to remove disparity in the prices of imported and locally-manufactured urea, the ECC approved the proposal that the Dealer Transfer Price (DTP) of 50kg imported urea may be revised upward at Rs1,805/bag by the NFML (exclusive of dealer margin of Rs145/bag) for the stocks sold between June 23 to July 25, 2022. The ECC was requested that the DTP of remaining stocks held with the NFML may be further revised upward to Rs2150/ bag (exclusive of dealer margin of Rs50/ bag) with effect from July 26, 2022, onwards.

Recently, an additional cargo has arrived.  If the government includes the recently arrived cargo in the calculation then there may be a reduction of Rs1 per liter on petrol. Petrol price may come down by Rs10 per liter if the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) does not include the fresh import in the determination of prices. The government has been playing tricks to keep the oil prices low and therefore, it is a possibility that it may choose the option of excluding the fresh cargo of petrol. In line with the Platts and exchange rate, high-speed diesel (HSD) price may decrease by Rs1.68 per litre.  The estimates are based on the last notified rate of petroleum levy (PL) and zero percent general sales tax (GST). The proposed revisions are subject to no increase or decrease in PL, GST imposition or exchange loss adjustment. Officials in the oil sector predicted that the PL on petrol would remain unchanged at Rs37.50 per litre on petrol and Rs7.50 per litre on HSD and that there would also be Rs11 adjustment for the previous month exchange loss as well. Another factor that can impact the price is the imposition of sales tax, they added.  The government may increase the sales tax on petrol and diesel to make revenue on the sale of these products. PSO is now looking for an exchange rate adjustment for petrol and HSD.  The price of HSD, however, may go down by around Rs1.68 per litre from Rs247.43 to Rs245.75 per litre.  In this calculation, the margin of the Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) and dealers on the sale of petroleum products would be Rs3.68 per litre and Rs7 per litre respectively.  This fortnight the average exchange rate taken has been Rs217.8, up by Rs11 compared to the last fortnight.  Sources said that the government and the regulator have been applying different maneuvers to keep the oil prices low to avoid political backlash.  As PSO imports petroleum products, the state-run oil marketing company is allowed exchange rate adjustments to save itself from losses.  In an attempt to minimise the impact of oil prices on the masses, the government devised a new formula for calculating the exchange rate for oil price revision. Earlier, it was taking the exchange rate of the last day, however, under the revised formula it is now taking the average exchange rate. On August 31, 2022, the last day on which the oil price revision was meant to be calculated, the exchange rate had come to Rs218.95. Instead, the government took an average exchange rate of Rs217.81.  The Ogra, however, built pressure on PSO to stagger the exchange adjustment loss. According to the existing mechanism, the government only takes PSO prices to set new prices for petroleum products in the country.  Currently, PSO receivables crossed Rs500 billion.

According to him, the increase in base tariff is due to the recent significant increase in fuel prices including RLNG, as well as, the non-provision of local gas to KE.

KE\u2019s borrowing levels on June 30, 2021 were Rs184 billion including Rs 116 billion representing mainly the working capital requirements.

Earlier, dialogues were held with State Minister for Petroleum, but despite assurances given by the government, no headway has been made.  The failure of talks prompted petroleum dealers to go ahead with their planned strike call, a dealer told Business Recorder.

Under the leadership of the central chairman of the association Abdul Sami Khan, they told reporters that the former government promised to increase distributors\u2019 commission to 6 per cent by June 2022. But, they lamented the government had yet not materialized its commitment. Majid Khan said the divisional presidents of the association fully endorsed the call of nationwide strike by PPDA and a meeting was also held in the chamber house for formal endorsement of the strike, which was announced to be observed on July 18 (tomorrow). The association office bearers demanded to fix dealers\u2019 margin by 6 percent as promised. Senior leader from Kohat Amjad Ali Shinwari fully backed the strike call on July 18, saying that doing business under present margin is not only difficult, but has been made impossible. He added the cost of business has been increased by 100 per cent, but an increase in profit was not made.

While addressing the meeting, the association central chairman Abdul Sami Khan via video link informed the participants that during the previous government, a meeting was held with the petroleum minister, which promised to increase dealers\u2019 margin at 6 per cent by June 2022. He said the demand was repeated during a meeting with the incumbent petroleum minister, but the association is compelled to go on strike after the government\u2019s non-seriousness attitude of the federal government toward accepting the demand, because the business is quietly difficult and impossible under the present dealers\u2019 margin.  Not only product value has increased but dealers\u2019 expenditures also surged up, the central chairman said. Therefore, he stressed the dealers should be united to raise voice for their genuine right with unanimity. Abdul Sami said dealers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had previously established a new example and expressed hope that they would continue their traditions in future and make the strike call successful on July 18. Later, the provincial chairman Majid Khan thanked the division presidents for their active participation and endorsement of the strike call. He hoped that they would be successful in attaining legitimate rights, if the dealers were united. SCCI president Hasnain Khrushid while addressing the meeting said the demands of dealers are legitimate and they have the legal right to use lawful ways to gain their due rights. He said the SCCI has hoped that the federal government would seriously consider issues and demands of the petroleum association and address them amicably.

The authority had not shared any written SOP\u2019s regarding price change formula.  As per the letter, since the OGRA had already revised the formula for calculating the exchange rate for oil price revision i.e. the exchange rate of the last day but now it has now revised the formula and started taking the average exchange rate. On August 1, the last day exchange rate was Rs.250 but the government took the average exchange rate of Rs 225 to reduce the oil prices which is neither prudent nor workable.  The recent revision of oil prices, as per an average exchange rate, would have resulted in an exchange rate adjustment of Rs. 31/liter for petrol and Rs. 16/ liter for high-speed diesel, but only Rs. 8.02/ liter exchange rate adjustment for petrol and Rs. 3.63/liter in case of high-speed diesel has been allowed which is neither prudent nor acceptable. \u201cAccording to the existing oil price review mechanism, the Government takes Pakistan State Oil Limited (PSO) prices to set new rates of petroleum products in the country. In the fresh oil price determination, PSO had worked out an exchange rate adjustment of Rs. 31/liter for petrol and Rs. 16/liter for high-speed diesel. It was supposed to be passed on to the consumers but it was turned down in order to cut oil prices and pass on minimum impact to consumers,\u201d says a letter. Oil Marketing Association of Pakistan demanded that OGRA should consider the recommendations of OMAP before finalizing the pricing mechanism. The association also demanded that C&F adjustment working should be shared with the industry. PSO C&F Adjustments complete working be shared with industry before every price change. The association further demanded that average HSD Premium quoted to top five (05) OMC, except PSO, may be considered for pricing in the country as PSO is working on Government-to-Government premiums which are far below the industry\u2019s average premium. Extra margin on HSD Premium earned by PSO may be recovered through IFEM mechanism. They also demanded that last day USD Exchange Rate published by SBP application may be applied for calculation of Prices. It is further pointed out that in case the necessary recommended steps are not taken in the light of the above, the already staggering oil industry will be near to complete collapse and OMCs may not be held responsible for the resultant ugly scenario. We fear the lifeline supply chain of petroleum products may be severely affected and the whole country will suffer irreparable loss.

Nine cargoes are expected to have been arranged for the month, which is one better than last month, but lower by 18 percent year-on-year. The story remains unchanged, as long-term agreements come handy in times of global supply crunch. This is not to say that the situation can\u2019t or won\u2019t change between November-February. Cancellations of cargoes even those under long-term arrangements are now a global phenomenon. Of late, the onus of supply has predominantly been on the state-owned PSO. Six cargoes under the 15-year agreement with Qatar at Brent slope of 13.37 percent have been priced in for September. It helps that the three-month average Brent crude price has fallen from $111/bbl last month to $106/bbl now. Expect even lower Brent average for next month, as June\u2019s price will make its way out \u2013 which could result in another 6-8 percent lower Brent used for October slope. Two additional cargoes have been priced at under 10.2 percent of Brent slope \u2013 taking PSO\u2019s average Delivered-Ex-Ship RLNG price at $13.47/mmbtu \u2013 only marginally higher month-on-month. Recall that August 2022 had three cargoes with 10.2 percent slope, which took the average DES price lower, despite higher Brent average for the reference period. A solitary cargo by the Pakistan LNG Limited has been priced in the provisional price for September 2022 \u2013 at 12.14 percent of Brent slope. Getting bids from the spot markets will remain a herculean task from hereon. Recall that Pakistan has floated a tender for another long-term arrangement of one additional cargo a month for the next six years. The government is believed to have formulated RLNG sector allocation for winters, under which domestic consumers will remain top priority. Power sector will take a backseat, and fertilizer usually plans the maintenance around peal winters to mitigate the impact. Gas price revision should be around the corner, and concerns over the gas circular debt getting out of control may be exaggerated at this point \u2013 as the authorities have principally agreed to revise consumer prices upwards by more than what is prescribed.

One of the main reasons of winding up from Pakistan is, among others, this larger policy of withdrawal. One is not sure if, after deregulation, the purported argument of attracting foreign investment and companies would work. Good riddance \u2014 there is enough experience locally in the sector. Foreign investment is not free; it causes foreign exchange drain. PSO (Pakistan State Oil), a government company, having a market share of almost 50-60%, is a major instrument of the writ of the government, all good and bad may be partially ascribed to this largest and listed company. Fortunately, being a listed company, there are many safeguards that are legally implemented. It is argued that due to the presence of PSO, price manipulation can be resisted, unless GoP becomes totally careless about it and its functionaries and government becomes beneficiaries of profiteering and loot. One has to be optimistic but the risk is always there. Besides, PSO privatization has been often talked about. It is said that Oil Refineries (ORs) are leading the demand for deregulating the oil sector. Oil refineries are outdated and lack scale economies, which requires a minimum capacity of 200,000 bbl/day. Under various pretexts, ORs have been extracting concessions such as deemed duty. In the new proposed oil policy also, they insisted on tax holidays and deemed duty. In all fairness, ORs had to be protected like other industries by a reasonable margin, otherwise ORs cannot survive in the long run. It is a separate matter that under the recent market situation they made hay while sun shines. Gross margins crossed 40% as opposed to a normal of 15-20%. Under deregulation, it is said that they expect higher margins and profits and have thus done away with erstwhile concession demands. Thus those who are dreaming of lower prices may be disappointed when reality arrives finally. On the other hand, this may not go uncontrolled. PSO may be a stabilizing market price leader. So long it is not privatised, it may continues to provide this function. In India, there is deregulation but market is controlled by three large public-sector companies. There is almost no difference in prices among the three public-sector companies, indicating some guidance or consensus-seeking process violating the spirit of true competition. The same may happen here with more frequency and intensity. Is competition delivering in advanced countries \u2014 yes and no? Will Petroleum prices come down under deregulation in Pakistan? What is the evidence from countries having open markets? Are prices being really determined there by real competition? Broadly and to a large extent; yes. There is considerable evidence of consensual and not a really competitive pricing. There may be price leaders which signal the sector if not outright conspiracy based price setting. Petrol pumps are charging more than they should. Let us quote from a recent U.K. publication: Only one in 10 petrol stations are charging a fair price for fuel and small local forecourts are giving drivers a better deal than the big boys, new findings have shown. Recent falls in the oil price should mean that price at the pumps should be at least 10p-a-litre cheaper, around 174p-a-litre for petrol, and much lower than the country\u2019s average 188p-a-litre. https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/19275630/uks-cheapest-petrol-station-try-small-forecourts/amp There are a number of business models governing the petrol distribution and selling business. Normal business models are: 1. COCO \u2014 oil Company Owned and Company Operated; CODO \u2014 Company Owned and Dealer Operated and DODO \u2014 Dealers Owned ad Dealers Operated. First and second kind of business models have a low prevalence due to investment amount and risks. Mostly, the DODO business model is practiced throughout the world. Under DODO, dealers are bound to buy from the OMCs (Oil Marketing Companies) and observe quality and safety practices as well. Dealers benefit from the reputation of OMCs and their infrastructure and stability of supply. Independent petrol pumps (IPPs) are a new innovation in the petroleum sector. IPPs are independent of any Oil Marketing Company (OMC), as the name implies; they can buy petroleum from any source. They have low overheads. In Europe, there is a 20% market share of IPPs. In nuevo capitalist countries like Bulgaria, IPPs market is even higher at 64%; it is 56% in Czech Republic. The market share and acceptability of IPPs is on the rise, as they invariably sell at a lower price than OMC-related petrol pumps. OMCs in the free markets charge a lot of overheads in the form of QA, safety and royalty, etc., but not in Pakistan. In Pakistan, OMCs\u2019 and dealers\u2019 margins are fixed by the regulator. It would be useful to quote from a recent article from a UK publication on the subject: \u201cIndependently owned fuel stations are more likely to offer fairer pricing that major retailers, according to the RAC\u2026.just 10% (407) of a sample of more than 4,500 UK forecourts are charging a \u2018fair\u2019 price for petrol and diesel, with the vast majority of these being independently owned sites rather than major fuel retailers\u2026\u2026Weekly wholesale petrol prices have fallen by a massive 17p a litre, from a weekly average of around 152p at the start of June to just 135p this week. Yet average pump prices have reduced by a paltry 4p.\u201dhttps://www.fleetnews.co.uk/news/car-industry-news/ In a lighter vein, our IPPs in Pakistan are the illegal petrol pumps. Reportedly, these have been closed down \u2014 difficult to believe? There were (are) 1,556 illegal petrol pumps (legal ones 8,000 +) which have all the business model characteristics of IPPs except that these are illegal and engage in many unhealthy practices. Can these be organized under an IPP scheme under special Ogra (Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority) rules? IPPs need not be restricted to these illegal pumps and bring bad name to the concept of IPPs which is expanding almost everywhere. IPPs are sometimes organized under voluntary business association or group bringing and promoting quality and image. Existing or a new petrol pump may be given the freedom and flexibility to become IPP or come out of it under rules and safeguard. Special Petrol Pumps for Motorcycles, which may have a price sensitive, may also be organized under IPPs. Options may be many. There are varying opinions and positions of stakeholders on the subject of deregulating the oil sector. Some people are skeptic of the deregulation. Businessmen and professionals associated with oil sector generally lament that the sector could not expand due to deregulation. They admit that prices and profits may increase in the short-run but in the long run supply side will improve and industrial development will take place. Governments have been confused and even scared as the choices are put before them. Open markets are the way to go forward in the world. However, petroleum is too risky and too large a sector. Open market is not a jungle world. There are rules that have to be made and abided by the sector. We have a Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP). Unfortunately, however, its role has been marred by a parallel judicial process which undoes or delays the determinations and orders of this regulator. CCP has organisational problems as well. Ogra may have to be remodeled as well. In any case, there is considerable overlap and confusing roles issues. OGRA has been empowered under recent regulations. As a World Bank report says, that while deregulating, new regulations have to be made. Considerable policy framework may have to be done before opening the floodgates of the open market. It may cause anarchy and market instability. Under the current circumstances, when there are so many challenges, especially, in the petroleum and energy sector, more risks and challenges cannot be added. However, there are those who say that the time window is always small in Pakistan usually. The following table classifies 97 countries depending on  which of the three main retail fuel pricing methods they  apply.

The government has already started unscheduled load of electricity in the country due to less supply of fuel to the power plants. The sources said electricity demand was on the rise due to hot weather but at the same time 800-900 MW free electricity from K-3, has been suspended due to a fault in the plant which triggered shortfall of 1000 MW, which has now been reduced to 400 MW. \u201cIf current fuel supply situation continues in the days to come, it would be very difficult to ensure uninterrupted supply of electricity in Ramazan,\u201d said an official on condition of anonymity. According to Secretary Energy, KP, there is a law and order situation in Lower Chitral and Upper Chitral due to 12 to 22 hours long load shedding.  People in Peshawar are also on the streets against prolonged unscheduled load shedding. However, Minister for Energy Hammad Azhar argues that there is no unscheduled load shedding in the country. \u201cNo unscheduled load shedding. Demand and supply is balance. Revenue-based load shedding only,\u201d he said while replying to a question sent by this correspondent.  On Tuesday afternoon, generation was 16790 MW which was equal to demand, except revenue-based load shedding. According to sources, recently, Central Power Purchasing Agency-Guaranteed (CPPA-G) wrote to the government that it was facing serious financial crunch due to low recovery from power Distribution Companies (Discos). CPPA-G requested the ECC to approve Rs 150 billion to clear overdue payments of coal-fired power plants, mostly owned by the Chinese companies, but the forum approved only Rs50 billion as Tariff Differential Subsidy (TDS) after Finance Ministry refused to support the proposal, citing financial woes. CFO, CPPA-G has stated that due to poor cash inflows/ remittances from DISCOS to CPPA-G, the overdue payables to CPEC projects amounted to Rs256.8 billion as on March 29, 2022. In this regard, ECC has already approved release of Rs100 billion in two tranches for payments to CPEC projects out of which Rs50 billion had already been paid to the CPEC projects. The current raise in the fuel prices has further added burden on the cash flow. He has requested the Power Division that release of Rs50 billion, the second tranche, be arranged as supplementary grant through MoF on urgent basis for onward payment to CPEC projects. Pakistan State Oil (PSO) has also made it clear that it cannot ensure supply of furnace oil to non-contractual consumers (IPPs). According to PSO, it has supplied 27,224 MTs fuel oil and will supply approx. 17,500 MTs to its contractual customers including Lalpir, Pakgen and KEL and 9,000 MTs to non-contractual customers including Saba Power, Liberty Tech and Nishat Chunian in remaining days of March, 2022. In addition to this volume, 44,000 MTs has been supplied to K-Electric and approx. 45,000MTs will be supplied to K-Electric in remaining days of the current month. However, PSO has stated that it will be responsible for the supply/ dispatch of fuel oil to its contractual customers. The supplies to non-contractual customers will be made on best endeavour basis and subject to availability of fuel oil. PSO\u2019s receivables have also reached the whopping level of Rs 650 billion as IPPs and Gencos are not clearing their due payables. Meanwhile, 200MW Nishat Power Limited, located 66 KM off Lahore Multan Road, Jamber Kalan Tehsil Pattoki District Kasur (LESCO grid area) is badly suffering from the ongoing RFO shortage in the country. The company has requested Power Division to issue a No Objection Certificate (NOC) to the Company to import around 5,000 Metric Ton RFO from OMC of their own choice. Nishat Power has cited reference of a CCoE decision taken on June 18, 2020 in which it decided that private IPPs may be allowed to import RFO through PSO or other OMCs after getting a NOC from the Power Division, \u2018which shall consult with Petroleum Division to ensure all local RFO is consumed first keeping in view the demand and supply situation.\u2019 General Manager, Engineering, KAPCO, in a letter to CPPA-G stated that PSO has intimated the tentative price of LSFO cargo will be around Rs 205,080/ MT inclusive of GST. This implies that price of generation from KAPCO\u2019s Energy Block-1 will be Rs34 per unit on LSFO and Rs 30.7 per unit on HSD whereas the generation cost of Energy Block\u20142 will be Rs 37.7 per unit on HSFO and Rs 33.8 per unit on HSD in March. In April 2022, generation forecast from KAPCO will be 468 GWh, which requires 98,000 MTs of HSFO whereas in May, 2022 generation forecast is 482 GWh, which needs 100,000 HSFO as no RLNG has been allocated to the plant.  However, KE, in its letter states that summer period has already started in Karachi and accordingly the power demand has increased, significantly. However, the gas supply to KE is still restricted at 95 MMCFD as compared to 152 MMCFD supplied to KE in the month of March and 257 MMCFD in the month of April last year. The power utility was of the view that as Ramazan is fast approaching it would be crucial for KE to operate SGTPS, KGTPS and Korangi CCPP plants to provide uninterrupted power supply to the people of Karachi.  KE has urged SSGC to increase the gas quota immediately to at least 190 MMCFD in line with the CCoE decision and maintain gas pressure at SGTPS (2.5 bar), KGTPS (2.5 bar) and KCCPP (4 bar) to fulfil the operational requirements of these plants.

Pakistan State Oil (PSO) is the parent company of PRL and hold majority of the 63.5 percent held by the associated companies. General public that includes foreign and local shareholders hold over 24 percent of PRL\u2019s share; the breakdown of the two is not given in the published accounts. Refineries have had a roller coaster ride in Pakistan. Last few years have been particularly difficult for the refining sector as it saw its earnings and margins dip. In FY14, earnings and, margins slipped when the refining margins for hydro-skimming refineries remained low due to sharp increase in crude oil prices and weak demand for products worldwide. And as margins dwindled due to high cost and working capital requirements, the local refining industry including PRL\u2019s profits took a toll. Though FY15 brought improvement in profit margins for PRL, it still wasn\u2019t a good year for the refinery segment. Issues highlighted above continued to linger, which along with steep decline in crude oil and product prices resulted in heavy inventory losses. PRL saw a 36 percent year-on-year decrease in its topline along with increased finance cost that resulted in after-tax losses. This aggravated the negative equity situation of the firm. This situation of negative equity had been an issue for PRL since 2010. In FY15 the board of directors announced a right issue at par to meet the capex and financial requirements of its projects. The highlight of FY15 was PRL finally commissioning its much awaited isomerization plant to convert low-value naphtha into gasoline (petrol), a premium product, which doubled its petrol production. In FY16 - despite a fall in the topline due to lower oil prices - earnings became positive due to healthy gross refinery margins (GRMs) and the doubling of production of motor gasoline given the full year operation of the new isomerization unit. The right-issue in FY15 and the firm\u2019s commissioning Isomerization plant played a key role in reducing the firm\u2019s reliance on bank borrowing and increasing operational liquidity. In FY17, PRL saw its profits improve by more than three times, which also brought some reduction to the negative equity. However, during the year, the refinery faced the deactivation of the catalyst of the isomerization plant, which reduced the firm\u2019s petrol production. The recovery that was seen in earnings in the last couple of years took a dip again in FY18 as PRL\u2019s profit after tax halved despite a healthy growth of 32 percent in the company\u2019s revenues. However, the company overcame the negative equity situation that it had been facing for long. Refining margins remained depressed during the year, which put pressure on gross profitability. Also, the catalyst of isomerization plant that was impaired in FY17 could not be operated at full capacity from July to November 2017, which resulted in squeeze in petrol production. Higher exchange losses due to currency depreciation and pressure on refinery operation due to decline in furnace oil demand amid its curtailment strategy by the government, and hence the buildup of stock pile also affected the refinery\u2019s performance in FY18. In FY19, the refinery posted staggering decline in earnings. The adverse factors that impacted the refining sector were the decline in the petrol prices, depressed refining margins and steep devaluation of currency locally. As a result the company incurred a loss of Rs5.82 billion in FY19 as compared to profit of Rs504 million in FY18. However, during the year, the Board of Directors of PRL approved the Refinery Upgrade Project through Refinery Upgrade Project to meet the regulatory requirement of EURO II compliant HSD. During FY19, Pakistan State Oil Company Limited (PSO) acquired 84 million shares from Shell Petroleum Company Limited, UK, which increased its shareholding in the company to 52.68 percent, making PSO the parent company of PRL. FY20 was marked by the global COIVD pandemic, which affected the demand for petroleum products in the country and amid crashing prices resulted in huge inventory losses for the refineries and OMCs. PRL took measures to control losses during the lockdown and restrictions in the early part of the global pandemic like reduction in throughput, sustainable production of higher grade fuel etc. The company acquired additional Class B shares from Shell Petroleum Company Limited, UK (Shell) and Chevron Global Energy Inc. (Chevron), which increased the shareholding of the parent company (PSO). PRL incurred additional loss from the downward adjustment in HSD prices as the company could not install Diesel Hydrodesulphurisation Unit (DHDS) to produce EURO II compliant HSD in time. FY21 was better for PRL. PRL\u2019s earnings witnessed a recovery primarily due to the company strategy during the pandemic. According to the company, this entailed changing the crude recipe (composition of crude procurement from local and international sources) and operational strategy that got additional revenues as well as lifted existing sales. PRL was able to produce premium products like low sulphur fuel oil, HSD and petrol that helped it save on differential price adjustment as well as get additional revenue from premium products. Growth in revenues for PRL in FY21 emanated from the last quarter\u2019s topline, where revenues climbed by 80 percent year-on-years, taking overall topline growth to 2 percent for FY21. As for the improvement in profitability, it was due to better product mix that tilted towards diesel and petrol; also, the exchange gains and change in pricing policy to fortnightly from monthly helped the PRL turn losses into profits. Exchange gains stemmed from the change in pricing mechanism for petroleum products which enables the refineries to recover some of the exchange losses suffered on crude oil imports through pricing of petrol and diesel. Moderate growth in expenses and increase in other income further supported the operating margins, while decline in finance cost due to lower interest rates during the period lifted net margins in FY21. The refinery sector has been under radar for not upgrading from its archaic technology, which resulted in the upliftment issue of furnace oil by the oil marketing companies amid falling furnace oil demand locally as well as globally. And the same factor has also affected the refinery sector\u2019s profitability. PRL\u2019s earning in 1HFY22 was seen going in the negative territory due to higher realized crude oil prices. While the revenues were up, PRL\u2019s volumetric sales were affected by the shutdown of refinery operations temporarily due to the falling demand for furnace oil and thus weak upliftment by the oil marketing sector. As per the company, the decline in earnings also came from exchange losses to the tune of Rs1.4 billion. Moderate growth in expenses and finance cost also impacted the operating margins. However, the silver lining for PRL is that it is the only refinery that is coming up with expansion and up gradation plans. The company announcement highlights that in December 2021, the board of directors made public announcement for PRL\u2019s expansion to undertake Refinery Expansion and Upgrade Project to produce EuroV compliant petrol and diesel, and expand the crude processing capacity to 100,000 barrels per day, and upgrade from hydro skimming to deep conversion refinery. This will help PRL ease its furnace oil upliftment challenge, for which recently the refinery has decided to find exports markets for its stored furnace oil at Port Qasim.

The financial crunch being faced by PSO and PLL was not only limiting their ability to procure LNG but also facing difficulty in meeting payment obligations of international suppliers. It was highlighted that a tariff differential of Rs. 162 billion had piled up because of diversion of costly LNG to domestic (residential) consumers past 4 winter seasons starting FY 2018-19.  Since the RLNG was diverted, as per the approved policy of the government; therefore, recovery of it may also be funded through the government subsidy. The Additional Secretary, Finance Division highlighted that some remedial and drastic tariff measures should be taken to avoid build-up of circular debt in gas sector as is the case in power sector. He further contended that fuel subsidies should be rationalized based on fiscal space available in the budget. The Minister of State for Petroleum also subscribed to the viewpoint of Additional Secretary Finance and stated that revision in gas tariff needs to be considered for rationalizing the subsidies between LNG price and indigenous gas price, and the LNG diverted to domestic sector (residential consumers) for past four winters.  The Finance Minister directed the Petroleum Division to come up with proposals for revisions in gas tariff. The ECC also approved the proposal of Petroleum Division with respect to allocation of Rs 36 billion as Supplementary/ Technical Supplementary Grant for the month of June 2022 in the head of Petroleum Division against supply of RLNG.

He further said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Energy Minister Musadik Malik had separate meetings with the government of Saudi Arabia on its assistance and investment in the oil and gas sector for Pakistan to ease down pressure on the economy. Noor Alam Khan chaired the meeting which examined the audit report of the Petroleum Division for the year 2019-20.  Responding to a question raised by Member Committee Rohail Asghar that the government of Saudi Arabia should be approached for an exemption on mandatory four to five percent interest rate charged by international banks as guarantees against Letters of Credit (LCs) so that Pakistan State Oil (PSO) or other public sector refinery could import crude oil from Saudi Arabia on reduced prices. The Petroleum Division Secretary replied that it was one of the requirements in all commercial agreements which could not be renegotiated; otherwise Saudi Arabia had to renegotiate all commercial contracts with other countries. He maintained that the federal government was importing oil from Qatar on credit facility of 80 days and LCs were opened on spot purchase. Pakistan was importing crude and refined fuel from various countries on long-term contracts, he added. He further revealed that the Petroleum Division was formulating a policy to give an extension of licences to the oil and gas exploration companies on the condition that they would resume their operations. Many of the foreign companies wind up their operation in Pakistan, he added. The committee further directed the Secretary Petroleum to probe into claims of the previous Government of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) that Russia was ready to supply oil at cheaper rates. Member Committee from the PTI Syed Shibli Faraz recommended the secretary to find out any initial discussion between Pakistan and Russian available in written on oil import. Responding to another question regarding local oil and gas production, the secretary said that Oil and Gas Development Company (OGDCL) and Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) and other exploration and production companies had suspended their operations in various places as they did not have investment as the circular debt of oil and gas reached to Rs1.5 trillion and reliance on imported fuel was increasing. The Chairman Committee observed that one of the reasons that contributed to a decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) in the oil and gas sector was the lengthy process of the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) awarding licenses to a company. He said OGRA was creating hurdles in the inflow of foreign investment in the oil and gas sector and was not resolving their issues. The secretary said, \u201cYes, it is a perception about the OGRA but everyone has his own opinion\u201d. During the audit of the PSO for the financial year 2014-17, an audit report pointed out that it was observed that claims of Rs2.1 billion on account of the IFEM could not be got settled from the OGRA due to non-conducting of IFEM audit since 2012. The audit report further states that the OGRA should adopt a timeline of completion of IFEM audit activity.

PLD (petroleum development levy) on gasoline has been increased from Rs 10 to Rs 20/litre; while on diesel, it has been increased from Re 0 to Rs 10.0/litre. No GST has been charged. A highly volatile Rupee-USD exchange rate makes analyses or comparisons very difficult. Pricing has been made on a weighted average of the exchange rate of the last fortnight at Rs 225.9 while the earlier prices were based on a lower exchange rate of Rs 210. In this period, international prices of both gasoline and diesel have come down; 15 days average price for gasoline came down from 121 USD/barrel to 103 USD/barrel (15% down) and diesel\u2019s came down from 149 USD/barrel to 132 USD/barrel(11.4% down). Under the IMF (International Monetary Fund) agreement, the GoP has to increase PLD gradually to Rs 50 per litre. Soon, another Rs 10 may have to be added in this respect. If the oil prices do not go down and exchange rate does not stabilize at  reasonable level of Rs 210, another increase would not be unavoidable. The GoP has still some space available in the form of customs duty that it levies at the rate of around Rs 23-25 per litre. There is some confusion about customs duty and its purpose. Is it to generate revenues or to support local refineries? There used to be deemed duties, which have perhaps been eliminated. Petroleum pricing in Pakistan is done on the basis of landing prices of PSO (Pakistan State Oil), which tenders its procurements regularly. Recently, high premiums are being charged by suppliers, which may partly be influenced by low PSO risk rating.  One does not understand why there is customs duty on gasoline imports from China? It should be otherwise. China has been benefiting from low priced supplies from Russia and Iran. Some JVs (joint ventures) with Chinese oil companies may enable us to get lower prices and premiums-hopefully. There are procurement and logistics inefficiencies as well which, if removed, may help reduce petroleum prices. However, the dichotomy is that any improvement in PSO efficiency hurts local refineries. New petroleum products\u2019 prices in Bangladesh have come as a bombshell in the region: petrol\u2019s price has been increased by 45% and diesel\u2019s and kerosene\u2019s by 41.7%. Petrol\u2019s price in Bangladesh is now 1.366 USD/litre as opposed to 0.961 USD/litre in Pakistan; and diesel\u2019s is 1.198 USD/litre as opposed to 0.98 USD/litre in Pakistan.  This is despite a significant reduction in Brent prices. However, heavy exchange rate reduction has influenced affordability in Pakistan. Petroleum prices in Bangladesh--after the new hike--are almost comparable with those in India. Earlier, there was not much difference between gasoline prices in Pakistan and Bangladesh. Bangladesh is facing similar or identical difficulties despite a less acute current account deficit issue. Bangladesh had been keeping oil prices lower in order to be competitive in exports in the region. It, too, has gone to the IMF but is in a better position than us. However, in India, gasoline prices are 37.5% higher than those in Pakistan. In India, prices are deregulated and there is mildly heavy taxation, still much lower than those in Europe. Also, there is both Federal Excise tax and State VAT in India.  In Pakistan, IFEM is charged to average the transport cost and keep the prices uniform throughout the country, except for some minor differences. In India, there is wide variation among states due to VAT and transportation costs. In New Delhi, prices are the lowest these days: gasoline\u2019s price in Mumbai is available at IRs 111.3/litre as opposed to  IRs 96.0/litre in India\u2019s capital. Diesel\u2019s prices vary as well. On the average, these days, taxation in India is 40-42% of the selling price as opposed to 12-13% in Pakistan, partly because of not charging GST. If the IMF requirements are met ultimately and GST is charged, there will be no difference between the taxation levels of Pakistan and India. If taxation and selling expenses are removed, gasoline base prices in Pakistan are 23.9% higher than those in India while diesel\u2019s prices are 11% higher.  This is, however, a back-of the-envelope estimate. India has a very large oil refining industry;  it exports petroleum products despite meeting a huge domestic demand. It only imports crude oil.  However, Pakistan has a small refinery sector catering for some 40% of the local requirement, while the rest is imported. Pakistan draws upon equally or more competitive and efficient world oil refineries than those situated in India. Pakistan\u2019s base prices should not be higher. Higher international oil prices and a falling Rupee have adversely impacted Pakistan\u2019s economy, causing heavy inflation as almost anything is oil dependent. It is hoped that international oil prices would keep coming down, and if the exchange rate is brought to a reasonable level, our difficulties may be contained in this respect. Hopefully, with the IMF agreement, this would be achieved.

Motor Gasoline (MOGAS) and High Speed Diesel (HSD) sales were up by 7% MoM and 12% MoM to 638,000 tons and 496,000 tons, respectively. However, FO sales declined by 7% on MoM. As compared to last year, Pakistan oil sales recorded 22% Year-on-Year (YoY) decline in August 2022 which is owed to double digit fall in all major petroleum products; MOGAS sales down by 26% YoY, HSD down by 26% YoY, and FO down by 35% YoY. The YoY drop in oil sales is primarily due to rise in fuel prices, lower car sales, lower transportation activity and monsoon season/floods which resulted in reduced demand of petroleum products, Saad Ziker said. Among the listed entities, Pakistan State Oil (PSO) sales posted increase of 4% on MoM while was down 23% on YoY to 791,000 tons.

On December 31, 2021, Privatisation Division briefed the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation about its plans with respect to both the combined cycle power plants and sought to issue necessary direction to Ministry of Energy for obtaining decision of CCoE as already decided by CCoP. Privatisation Division also proposed that in the event of moving forward with privatisation of GPP and NPB, the concerned Ministries may also be directed to take necessary actions to resolve the problems hampering privatisation of these power plants. While approving the proposal, CCoP directed the Privatisation Division to continue the process of financial evaluation of Nadipur and Guddu power plants along with their assets. In the meanwhile, the Petroleum Division in consultation with the Power Division and Finance Division shall examine the matter of equity transfer to PSO against its receivables and present the issue before CCoE in the first place.

KE\u2019s Chief Regulatory Affairs & Government Relations Officer, Imran Qureshi, in his letter has stated that the recent trend of PLL buying spot cargoes at extremely high price in the range of $25/ MMBTU to $35/MMBTU, leads to immense hike in PLL\u2019s price of RLNG which is alarming for KE; this is in case the determination of RLNG Sale Price for PLL\u2019s supply to K-Electric is restricted to PLL cargos only, as contrary to the pricing regime for other power plants in the country that are being supplied RLNG at the basket rate notified by OGRA, i.e., at weighted average cost of higher priced PLL cargos and a greater number of lower priced long term PSO cargos. According to KE, the need of spot cargos arises either to bridge default of long-term cargos or to meet ad-hoc domestic and/ or system demand of SNGPL that has no correlation with KE. Therefore, the power utility understands that LNG molecules price for KE will either be based on the average of OGRA notified DES prices of both PSO and PLL cargos as being done for other power plants, or will be restricted to PLL cargos under the long-term contract only with the exclusion of spot cargos, if any purchased by PLL. KE is of the view that the fuel cost is a pass through, so any inequality in the RLNG pricing for PLL\u2019s supply to KE as compared to the other power plants in the country should be avoided as it would lead to injustice with the large population of country\u2019s economic hub situated in gas producing Sindh province. KE has also claimed that it has already been deprived of locally produced natural gas which is in disregard to Article 158 of the constitution; and in any scenario if KE consumers have to bear the extra cost of immensely high-priced spot LNG cargos that are primarily purchased by GoP to fulfil the needs of SNGPL\u2019s consumers it will not be justified. \u201cIt is extremely crucial that the determination of RLNG Price for PLL\u2019s supply to KE is done in a justified manner, so that KE\u2019s consumers in Karachi and adjoining areas are not treated differently from rest of the country,\u201d he continued.

The letter further says, although FX losses of 60 days are covered, if PSO opens shorter LCs or settles its LCs before 60 days and leaves the balance for GoP to settle through G2G arrangements, it leaves both OMCs and the GoP at the receiving end of FX losses rather than passing it in the prices. After a significant devaluation of the PKR since June 2022, FX Losses should have been passed on in the prices. However, to protect the public, PSO was asked to stagger the recovery of these losses. This coupled with subsequent devaluation impacts have resulted in a massive backlog. It is estimated that if the same is to be recovered by OMCs, it will require an FX adjustment of approximately Rs 100 per litre prices of MS and HSD. This also implies that the OMCs\u2019 working capital has been depleted by these amounts and they are facing shortage in opening LCs due to this reason as well.  Furthermore, the abrupt ban on import of HSD on OMCs, other than PSO, will also prevent recovery of even the staggered amounts, effectively wiping the same from the profits of the OMCs. As pet the letter in the past, OMC margins have been revised at the same time as dealer margins. The industry had been working with OGRA and MoE (Petroleum Division) for the revision with the focus on following points which includes ECC had approved in December 2021 that certain cost heads of OMCs such as demurrages, turnover tax, stocks/line fill in White Oil Pipeline and digitization should be reviewed by OGRA and includes in the oil prices. However, this review was not undertaken by OGRA. In July 2022, OGRA was reiterated the above decision with direction to conduct the review by 10 August 2022 and present to the ECC for implementation wef. 1 September 2022. Despite the industry working with the Petroleum Division and OGRA and finalizing the revised OMC margin of Rs 6 per litre, no notification has been made for more than last one and a half months. The impact of above matters has a direct impact on the liquidity of the industry and in particular, any misstep on account of FX losses has the potential to cause existential challenges to OMCs. It is requested that OGRA should be instructed to immediately address the issue of FX losses and revised OMC Margins should be immediately announced so the industry can survive and continue to invest in the energy needs of the country.  It is pertinent to mention that the above matters are burning issue since long and are badly denting the working capacity & eco system for OMCs. We have taken this matter up to almost all the available forums and requested multiple time for its early redressal, but all in vain. We request an urgent intervene and redressal of our boiling issue which on contrary will lead OMCs to collapse. We also request your good self to allocate time for meeting at your suitable convenience, for a personal hearing.   It is pertinent to mention here, that various discussions have been held on the above subject with OGRA, MEPD and MoF, before the announcement prices of petroleum products on 30 September 2022.

Finally, wef 1 March 2020, a new mechanism was put in place whereby actual FX Losses / Gains incurred by PSO on LCs of up to 60 days were to be built into the prices thereby saving the industry from significant losses.

The policy has led to an unsustainable yawning gap in the fiscal space and finally translated into the circular debt, currently hovering around Rs. 2.4 trillion. Finance Ministry maintains that the immediate way forward to address the flow of circular debt, as well as, to address the liquidity crisis like situation is to notify the average tariff of all Discos as uniform tariff with the approval of the competent authority, i.e., ECC/ Cabinet. For sustained supply of subsidized gas to industrial including zero-rated sector, Finance Ministry has proposed that subsidized LNG rate may be determined keeping in view the fiscal space provided through budgetary allocation for the next fiscal year to help prevent the flow of circular debt in the gas sector.

Finance Division has requested Petroleum Division to provide approval of the ECC/ Cabinet regarding diversion of LNG to domestic sector, during the ECC meeting and processing the release by Finance Division. Petroleum Division will release the amount to SNGPL against the principal amount of verified subsidy claims. Petroleum Division, in its summary, has claimed that Pakistan State Oil Company Limited (PSO) and Pakistan LNG Limited (PLL) are importing LNG to minimize shortfall in the gas demand and supply. The re-gasified LNG is supplied by SSGC and SNGPL to consumers including power sector as major consumer in summer months.  During June to Sep 2022, maximum LNG is planned to be imported for supply to power sector to minimize load shedding.  According to the plan, PSO will import 6 cargoes each month starting from June to September 2022. PLL will also import same quantity of cargoes during these months, of this in June, July and September 2022 three cargoes each to be imported on term basis whereas the same quantity will be imported on spot. However, in August 2022, one cargo will be on term basis and five cargoes on spot. The planned import will be subject to securing spot cargoes through tenders and timely opening of LCs and payments to LNG suppliers. SNGPL has planned to supply 720 to 780 MMCFD to power sector whereas PLL will be ramping up its direct supplies to KE from 62 MMCFD in July to 130 MMCFD in Oct 2022. Due to Russia-Ukraine situation and international demand supply dynamics, the price of one spot LNG cargo is hovering around Rs. 15 to 16 billion, enhancing the liquidity requirement of LNG importers. Besides LNC import PSO is also importing Furnace Oil (FO) to meet demand of power sector, which is adding to its financial constraints. PSO and PLL have furnished their projected liquidity requirement during summer months. The overall gross liquidity requirement of both PSO and PLL will be Rs 1.977 trillion till September 2022 of which Rs 525 billion will be for June, Rs 489 billion for July, Rs 493 billion for August and Rs 470 billion for September. PSO\u2019s financial requirement will be Rs 1.699 trillion for both LNG and furnace oil, of which Rs 427 billion is required for June, Rs 445 billion for July, Rs 413 billion for August, Rs 414 billion for September. PLL\u2019s gross liquidity requirements will be Rs 278 billion of which Rs 98 billion will be for June, Rs 44 billion for July, Rs 80 billion August, Rs 56 billion for September.  The requirements have been discussed with relevant stakeholders while considering the projected receipts of PSO and PLL from SNGPL, SSCC, power sector and credit lines available with the companies.  It was concluded that there will be still an average shortfall of Rs. 52 billion per month (PSO Rs 39 billion PLL Rs 14 billion) as per following details: (i) June - Rs 36 billion (PSO Rs 26, PLL Rs 10 billion); (ii) July - Rs 42 billion (PSO Rs31 billion, PLL, Rs 11 billion);(iii) August - rs69 billion (PSO Rs 52 billion, PLL Rs 17 billion); and (iv) September - Rs 63 billion (PSO 46 billion, PLL Rs 17 billion). The liquidity shortfall is likely to happen due to two reasons, i.e., delayed payments by CPPA to SNGPL on account of RLNG supply to power plants (only 28% of payments have been received from CPPA in May 2022 against the invoices raised) and secondly due to delay in income tax refund to SNGPL, etc., resulting in further delay in payment to PSO and PLL. The shortfall will aggravate the prevailing liquidity crunch of SNGPL, PSO and PLL making fuel supply chain vulnerable.  Petroleum Division has claimed that the ECC, in its decision of May 11, 2018 and June 6, 2020 allowed SNGPL to divert LNG during winter months to domestic consumers having much lower tariff while OGRA was directed to allow recovery of RLNG diversion cost/ tariff differential through monthly RLNG pricing. OGRA has maintained its stance that Government may consider to fund the tariff differential in respect of diversion of RLNG and it does not appear fair and equitable to cross-subsidize RLNG consumers. Therefore, recovery of diversion cost of RLNG is still outstanding and as of April, 2202 an amount of Rs. 162 billion has accumulated impacting SNGPL\u2019s ability to pay to PSO and PLL against RLNG supply. Petroleum Division, in its proposal has requested that in order to maintain the sustainability of the LNG supply chain, as well as, import petroleum products in the country, supplementary allocation/ TSG of Rs 36 billion for June 2022 may be approved under the head of Petroleum Division. The allocated amount shall be released to SNGPL against pending claims in respect of cost of the RLNG diversion to domestic sector for setting off the payable of PSO and PPL against RLNG supply.  Petroleum Division further requested that liquidity requirement of Rs 171 billion for the months of July-September 2022 may also be approved. Finance Ministry has supported the summary to the extent of a TSG/ SG of Rs.36 billion. However, having no fiscal space for the proposed allocation of Rs. 174 billion in the next financial year\u2019s budget, Finance Division has not support the proposal.

In accordance with the decisions of the meeting, the CPPA-G has also approached this Division that due to rising fuel prices and payments required to be made to the IPA, the sector is still facing a shortfall of about Rs200 billion. The CPPA-G has requested that a supplementary grant of Rs50 billion is required immediately to ensure the availability of requisite fuel to cope with the increasing demand of electricity during the summer months. It is reiterated that the power sector is currently facing a liquidity crisis which has worsened due to the rise in energy prices in the international market. In this scenario, the credit lines of IPPs have exhausted to procure fuel and IPPs are pressing hard for clearance of the outstanding receivables. Therefore, immediate cash release is required to manage the liquidity crunch.

This phenomenon happened due to complete shutdown of all kinds of manufacturing and economic activities across the world due to the unprecedented Covid-19 spread. With the economic recovery re-start, global attention shifted to the weather-related severe events (droughts, food shortages, heavy rains, floods, uncontrollable forest fires, earthquakes, air pollution, etc.), pushing for replacing the fossil fuels of all kinds at expedited rates to reach to the NetZero by 2050. As a result of this push by the UN, environmentalists and the activists, the energy producing OPEC+ countries stopped making investments for increasing their capacities and upgrading their capabilities.  As the world was getting handle on the Covid-19 pandemic and the global economic recovery was picking up its momentum, the energy demand started escalating and, in some cases, stretched beyond its current capacity.  Additionally, the power plants that were using coal as their fuel for producing electricity, they started switching to LNG as the cleaner source of fuel. Lastly, with the US led continued sanctions on Iran and Venezuela, their capacities were still out of reach. On top of it, political turmoil in Libya, Algeria, and Iraq, further curtailed energy supply in the global market. All these events caused further strain on the already fragile LNG supply leading to shortages and skyrocket prices, creating \u201cperfect storm\u201d for the energy (oil and gas) market.  While the LNG market was still highly volatile, the Russia-Ukraine war in late February added another dimension to the global LNG supply. Historically, Europe has been heavily dependent on the energy (~45% gas and 29% oil) supply from Russia due to its proximity and favorable logistics costs through the network of pipelines.  Germany, the 4th largest global economy and the European economic powerhouse, was importing above 40% of its gas, 35% of oil and >54% of coal from Russia for its energy needs. Gas was coming through the Nord Stream1 pipeline built in 2011 under a JV between Russia and Germany to supply Russian gas for the next 50 years. In 2021 another pipeline, called the Nord Stream2, was completed but due to the US objections, Germany never used it. Now it has been abandoned, and Germany has to write-off its part of over 6-billion-dollar investment. After the invasion of Ukraine, the US imposed economic sanctions against Russia, including freezing of its US dollar accounts and removing it from the SWIFT network. The US also asked the EU and its allies to stop importing their energy from Russia.  In its retaliation, Russia started slowing down its energy supply to the EU and demanding payments in its own currency, Ruble. With the continued war intensification, prices of LNG and oil, both have shot up in the unprecedented territory in the history of OPEC+. The geopolitical manoeuvring and supply and price volatility in the LNG market have created an incredibly challenging situation not only for the developed economies but also much colossal challenges for the developing countries.  Pakistan being in the developing countries\u2019 group has suffered the most in its LNG procurement. By diving deep into Pakistan\u2019s procurement procedure, it is very evident that the process for procurement that Pakistan is using is from its colonial past, thus not only very outdated, and cumbersome but it requires a lot of resources for completing the paperwork associated with the tenders.  Additionally, the people in charge of the LNG procurement in the Ministry of Energy are said to be not only inexperienced but are also not trained in the digital era of RFQ & RFP dynamics.  Under the new regimen of tenders for July LNG shipments, except for one cargo offer, no other offers have been made to-date by any other trading company for most of July period (July 3-4, 8-9, and 25-26), leaving Pakistan to choke for its survival without pushing the country to its \u2018life-support ventilators\u2019. According to sources, the only offer made was by Qatar for July 30-31 delivery at a price of $39.80/MBTU.  This should be a red flag for PSO, PLL and other energy procurement agencies of the Ministry as it confirms that even though the colonial masters developed the current procurement, but it is not working.  And if it is not changed to a simpler mechanism, like the RFQ/RFP process, Pakistan will continue to face its energy supply nightmares making it more vulnerable with time as LNG will continue to be in short supply until additional capacity by Qatar and others is not brought on stream. Additionally, with the continued global recovery and more switching to LNG from coal & oil, its supply will get worse before getting any better!  By keeping the status quo, procurement of LNG will be getting increasingly challenging, at least in the foreseeable future. As a result, not only will Pakistan\u2019s power generation suffer (even by switching to coal or high sulfur oil), but most importantly its fertilizer production (for its agriculture) will be calamitous.  Extended power supply outages will hamper the manufacturing output that will reduce its exports significantly. In turn, it will create higher trade imbalances and put additional burden on the balance of payments and that could push Pakistan toward the insolvency crisis. Thus, in order Pakistan to secure its LNG supplies, it is in its best interest to reform its procurement process in line with the digital age procurement protocols. Additionally, under the current highly volatile LNG supply conditions, Pakistan should approach to China for help in procuring its LNG supplies through China\u2019s experienced and well-connected industry network.  Pakistan should develop a pricing formula in consultation with China, (like: LNG market price + Transportation cost + discharging costs + a service fee), to make it a fair and acceptable proposition for the procurement companies (SINOPEC, Petrochina, Sinochem, etc.).  This way, it will add further leverage to Chinese procurement channels for negotiating better pricing from the LNG suppliers against certain committed offtake every month. It will be a win-win situation for all the parties involved and Pakistan will be able to have a steady supply of LNG volume for its national needs. In the meantime, Pakistan should develop its energy security policy also by borrowing Chinese playbook.

Already, there are reports of unscheduled load shedding throughout the country, which means it didn\u2019t take long for the government\u2019s claims to the contrary to ring very hollow.  And directing concerned departments to ensure necessary funds in a hurry might make good headlines, but things are rarely so easily handled on the ground. To add to the financial troubles, it\u2019s been learnt that electricity demand has jumped about 45 percent year-on-year this April; hence the shortage in some plants. The temperature has also shot up earlier than expected this year, putting more upward pressure on demand at a time when the fuel position of some plants is severely compromised. Things have actually got to the point that the National Power Control Centre (NPCC) has informed the ministry that operations of power plants will simply cease if required fuel is not made available immediately.  So it\u2019s now apparently been decided that NPCC will provide the daily fuel requirement of each power plant to the Central Power Purchasing Agency-Guaranteed (CPPA-G) and Pakistan State Oil (PSO) till the end of the month.  That way CPPA-G will release funds to PSO which will then supply fuel to the plants. But since resources are scarce and this crisis must be resolved in time to make sure there isn\u2019t any more unpleasantness during Ramazan, it\u2019s also been decided to supply plants with depleted stocks from plants with surplus stocks; which makes sense under the circumstances. One big reason for this problem is the government\u2019s refusal to admit that one exists to begin with. Even recently, as there were reports of unusually long, unscheduled loadshedding up and down the country, especially in northern areas, the energy minister brushed aside all criticism by simply tweeting that there was no such thing. It\u2019s another matter, of course, that day long power outages led to protests in areas like Chitral and even Peshawar.  The main issue then, as now, was lack of adequate fuel with power plants. Usually, they keep buffer stocks to meet sudden surge in demand, as is happening now, but depart from the practice whenever the government is unable to clear due contractual payments, because then the plants are unable to make required purchases in advance. Just last week CPPA-G told the government about financial problems arising from low recoveries from Discos (distribution companies) and asked for Rs150bn to clear overdue payments, but was given only Rs50bn. Now, Director General Oil has said that fuel shortfall at plants would have a direct impact on the entire power sector, especially since a surge in demand for petroleum products is expected from April to June 2022; and it will be very difficult to meet unless funds are paid to PSO to reduce receivables.  These receivables have grown to around Rs84 billion which, after adding almost another Rs84b in Late Payment Surcharge (LPS), amount to a grand total of Rs167.3b. But he\u2019s requested the power division to ensure payment of only Rs25bn by April 15 so the supplier can at least avoid default; so cramped is the state of affairs as the government struggles to honour its word of keeping the lights on during Ramazan. It\u2019s unfortunate that the PTI (Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf) government is leaving the power sector more or less how it found it; in a state of acute disarray. And just like its predecessors, it could only watch from the side as different links in the financial chain just failed to hold it together and the circular debt kept soaring. Considering how things have been, it\u2019s a small miracle already that the power situation is not much worse in the holy month.

In foreign countries, the downstream oil market-place is open and provides free access to every organization or independent player; this leads to deregulation of oil market.  \u2018Deregulation\u2019 is the elimination of the control of the government from a sector or a particular industry and to allow them to do free trade in an efficient market-place. Deregulating the oil market would mean that there would be no support from the government in the form of Inland Freight Equalization Margin (IFEM).  The cost of inland movement borne by a refinery for the transport of crude oil from the source to the refinery is known as the Inland Freight Equalization Margin (IEFM).  As a result of deregulation, there will be competition in the delivery of the services and this will enable the consumers to make a wide range of choices in the quest for their satisfaction. For the understanding of deregulation, one must first have to understand the regulation, as we know that there is no smoke without fire, so that is why there is no deregulation without regulation.  Regulation means any legal tool or legislation or any type of executive policy or an element of the constitution or the political socio-economic control by the government. Traditionally, prices of petroleum products in Pakistan have been regulated by the government itself. So the Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) present in the country, namely, Pakistan State Oil (PSO), Shell Pakistan, Total, Be Energy & Hascol, have been selling their regular and premium petroleum products at similar prices throughout the country.  This regulation in the oil industry has had its stumbling blocks - the greatest being financial uncertainty for OMCs, since petroleum pricing is a popular political tool. Whereas, deregulation on premium petroleum products has been a meander for an industry going through a dead-heat. If the government goes ahead with deregulation it would have an uncooperative impact on the consumers.  There will be a cynical reaction from the public by imposing this policy but it can be effectively countered by public awareness. But if we look in the longer term, the costs of petroleum will rise right away post-deregulation but will fall over time as new businesses enter the market and competition increases. After deregulation oil companies will charge pricing according to demand and supply forces; they can be guaranteed of a more stable financial outlook.  This market-driven pricing will also encourage product differentiation, supply chain cost optimization, and superior forecourt services - all benefiting the end consumers. Ultimately, deregulation of petroleum prices will help the oil refineries invest more and more in the oil industry and the Oil Marketing Companies would also be able to expand their storage capacity and retail networks. Deregulation can be at best, in concept, an informed move by the government if done right and will provide businesses the chance to order and store petroleum goods at reasonable prices. Along with potentially lowering prices in some areas, it will increase the number of new jobs available to the occupants by encouraging foreign and domestic investment.  In Japan, for example, after the complete deregulation of electricity in 2016-17, the gas sector was also deregulated. As a result of which, oil, gas, and telecommunication sectors directly set foot in electricity retailing.  In opposition to deregulation in Pakistan, factors such as rising fuel prices, the hoarding of fuel, a loss of revenue for the government, as well as the political cost for the government play a huge role. These factors can have dignified implications towards deregulating the sector. Deregulation is a pragmatic approach of the government, and it will create opportunities for the companies to order and stock fuel products economically. Not only will it create competitive prices, it will also create a lot of new job opportunities for people.  The government should provide a good policy structure, thus clearing the way for ease of doing business to get the positive impact of deregulation on Pakistan\u2019s economy. No doubt, it\u2019s a prolonged process and a very time consuming exercise.  It is important to consider the interests of a diverse set of stakeholders, especially those of customers and key players in the sector. Favoring one over the other can result in severe negative consequences for the government.

According to the open letter, Pakistan is presently in the midst of one of the worst economic crises in its history. High inflation, large twin deficits, dwindling forex reserves, fast weakening currency and elevated Eurobond yields are all symptoms of an economy in severe distress.  The country\u2019s external and fiscal finances are crumbling under the overwhelming weight of energy costs. The share of imports, which was 43% of total primary energy supply in FY 2020, has been continuously increasing.  At more than $ 26 billion, energy imports (oil, LNG and coal) were the single biggest contributor to Pakistan\u2019s current account deficit of $ 17.4 billion in FY 2022. It is tragic that a country endowed with large fossil fuel reserves and huge renewable resources meets more than 2/5th of its energy needs through imports.  The experts are of the view that decades of misguided policies have fostered energy inefficiency and favoured imports over development of indigenous energy resources. Misgovernance and policy failures have created a monster in the form of circular debt which has devoured trillions in budgetary resources and yet there in an outstanding circular debt stock of over Rs 3.2 trillion in power and gas sectors combined.   They said that national dignity and security are compromised with each economic bailout that Pakistan seeks from close friends, international donors, and multilateral lenders, adding that as the nation celebrated the diamond jubilee of its independence, it must take a moment to introspect as to why our country has failed to achieve economic sovereignty in the last 75 years?  The experts maintained that the energy sector has the potential to swing from being the biggest burden on the country\u2019s economy to propelling it towards economic security and prosperity. This course reversal, however, will require unflinching commitment by political leaders and decision-makers to energy sector reforms in the face of inevitable resistance from the current beneficiaries and deeply-entrenched vested interests. There is a dire need for non-partisan commitment and support for energy sector reforms. The experts have submitted the following recommendations to the political leaders and decision makers.    The experts have suggested that Nepra and Ogra must be turned into first class regulatory bodies staffed with professionals. Public Sector Entities (PSEs) that are not to be privatised should be made autonomous, not just on paper but in reality.  They said that Pakistan should conserve energy as 5% energy savings would reduce the energy import bill by 12% or over $ 3.0 billion.  They have suggested the following measures for meaningful reduction in energy consumption (i) introduction of daylight saving timing by moving clocks forward by at least one hour; (ii) closure of shopping centres by 7 pm and restaurants/wedding halls by 10 pm; (iii) closure of bank branches by 2 pm; (iv) closure of all public/private offices at 5 pm; (v) reduction of school working days to four per week with longer hours per working day; (vi) keeping minimum temperature setting for air-conditioning at 26 degrees in all public and private offices; and (vii) switching off alternate street lights.  The experts have urged on use of indigenous resources to generate energy saying that solar and wind projects can be developed within 6 to 12 months and also in a modular manner to fit more precisely with the demand projections.  Conversion of existing wind farms to wind/solar hybrid models should be allowed where it is economically feasible. Expansion of rooftop solar installations can be further accelerated through financing schemes and ensuring faster net-metering approvals. Setting up a state-of-the-art refinery with integrated petrochemical complex is another key requirement given the present redundant inefficient refinery infrastructure and the need for substitution of imported petroleum products.  The experts further proposed that entire public sector transport system be converted to electric system and hybrid wind/solar farms could be setup to power the electric buses by wheeling electricity through KE\u2019s network. To reduce energy inefficiency in captive power generation, minimum thermal efficiency standards for different fuels should be defined and enforced.  Deregulation of price controls and privatisation of energy sector, PSEs is the most logical path to achieving energy sector sustainability in Pakistan. Unwarranted fears about cost of stranded assets to the government are used to stymie progress towards competitive energy markets. The Competitive Trading Bilateral Contract Market (CTBCM) model must be implemented in letter and spirit. The gas markets should also be opened up on a similar model.

Pakistan had cut fuel oil imports since the second half of 2018 as LNG prices were low, but it had to at times switch back to oil since July 2021 because of sky-high LNG prices.  The country's fuel oil imports could climb to about 700,000 tonnes this month, after hitting 630,000 tonnes in May, according to Refinitiv estimates.  Imports last peaked at 680,000 tonnes in May 2018 and 741,000 tonnes in June 2017. A spokesman for Pakistan's energy ministry cited global prices as the reason for the surge in fuel oil imports.  The trend is set to continue in July too, as Pakistan State Oil (PSO) received offers from Coral Energy to supply two high sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) cargoes and one low sulphur fuel oil (LSFO) cargo for second-half July delivery, industry sources said.  PSO had sought five cargoes in the tender, according to its website. \"Import data indicates that thermal power generating companies in Pakistan made the initial switch from gas to fuel oil late last year and the price dynamic provides an ongoing incentive to max out fuel oil purchases over LNG,\" said Timothy France, a MENA senior oil analyst at Refinitiv.  Asia LNG spot prices jumped last week, tracking European gas prices, as an extended shutdown at a US export plant prompted buying by Japan and South Korea.  Pakistan LNG, in its second attempt to buy four LNG cargoes for July delivery, received only a single supply bid for one cargo from QatarEnergy on Thursday. Pakistan LNG, however, did not pick up the supply bid due to the cost.  The country, which is facing a severe energy crisis, has been in a conservation mode to reduce consumption and stave off blackouts.  \"Weather conditions in Pakistan appear highly supportive of demand. Cooling demand typically remains high until mid-September, which implies that imports could remain elevated in June, July and August,\" France added.  While fuel oil-based power generation was relatively steady year-on-year, it climbed 15% in May from the previous month, data from Topline Research showed.

Sharing the details, sources said, in a meeting held on August 1, 2022 M/s Pakistan LNG Limited (PLL) noted that there may be likelihood of non-supply of its term cargoes during September and November 2022, considering prevailing supply trend in global market conditions. Later on, PLL, in its letter of August 04, 2022 shared the available regasification rates of terminal-2 while considering non-supply of said term cargoes.  The matter was taken up with SNGPL seeking RLNG availability for power sector. In this connection M/s SNGPL has apprised that KE has indicated its revised requirement due to a fault in its plant and therefore any spare RLNG volumes from KE will be available to be supplied to SNGPL. Furthermore, Mari Petroleum has also indicated provision of gas supplies as per monthly nomination profile proposed by them in a letter of August 10, 2022. According to the update provided by SNGPL, with respect to availability of RLNG for seven months (September 2022 to March 2023), eight cargoes (PSO =6+2) of 705 MMCFD will be available in September 2022, of which 380 MMCFD will be supplied to power sector against power demand of 875 MMCFD and Delivery Plan of 437MMCFD, In October 2022, total nine RLNG cargoes of 849 MMCFD (PSO=6+2, PLL=1) will arrive of which 365 MMCFD will be supplied whereas in November nine cargoes of 806 MMCFD (PSO= 6+3) will arrive. However, supply to power sector will be 365 MMCFD in October and 210 MMCFD in November respectively. The government has arranged 10 cargoes (PSO=6+3, PLL=1) for December, 2022 but power sector will get only 268 MMCFD. For January, February and March 2023, nine cargoes of 875 MMCFD (PSO=6+2, PLL=1) for each month have been arranged of which 115 MMCFD, 237 MMCFD and 390 MMCFD of RLNG will be supplied to the power sector respectively in these three months against demand of 510 MMCFD, 350 MMCFD and 380 MMCFD. SSGC and KE retention has been assumed to be 85 MMCFD in September, 165 MMCFD in October 145 MMCFD in November and 150 MMCFD in December 2022 whereas retention for first quarter of 2023(January, February and March) will be 150 MMCFD. Of this retention for KE will be 10 MMCFD in September, 90 MMCFD in October, 70 MMCFD in November and 75 MMCFD in December 2022 whereas in January, February and March 2023, it will be 75 MMCFD each month. The sources said that SSGC retention has been assumed at 75 MMCFD whereas supply to CNG sector will be completely suspended till March 2023. The sources maintained that supply to fertilizer sector will be suspended during Jan-Feb, 2023 while 50 per cent supply to Captive Power Plants (CPPs) in Punjab will continue to be curtailed till November 2022 and Feb-March 2023 and 75 per cent supply to be curtailed in January 2023. For December-2022, gas supply shall be provided at 25 per cent from 1-10 and 50 per cent shall be supplied thereafter.

SNGPL would not be able to meet the Annual Delivery Plan (ADP) of Government Power Plants (GPPs) in December 2022 and January and February 2023. Directorate General of Gas (Petroleum Division) maintains that SNGPL shall endeavour to provide maximum RLNG to power sector. However, owing to limited number of cargoes, RLNG could not be provided as per ADP of power plants which may trigger Liquidated Damages (LDs) from power plants/power purchaser.

Ogra is empowered to determine annual revenue requirements of the two companies, on the basis of petitions filed by these companies, in accordance with the respective license conditions, Natural Gas Tariff Rules 2002 and Section 8 of the OGRA Ordinance 2002.  The process of filing of petitions for the determination of Estimated Revenue Requirement (ERR) for a new financial year starts in the third quarter of the financial year, followed by public hearings and OGRA decision in fourth quarter of the year, which is then referred to the Federal Government for advice in terms of category wise consumer sale prices.  Under section 8(3) of the OGRA Ordinance, 2002 such advice has to be provided within 40 days of the decision. The Ogra issued its determination of Estimated Revenue Requirements for FY 2022-23 on June 3, 2022 for both SNGPL and SSGC. According to the determination SNGPL requires a revenue of Rs261 billion and SSGCL requires a revenue of Rs285 billion in FY 2022-23.  The Ogra has not allowed previous year revenue shortfall of Rs.265 and Rs. 245 billion for SNGPL and SSGC respectively. This disallowance would result in continuation of the stock of circular debt in future. The recovery from consumers is based on Ogra notified tariffs for various categories and slabs of consumers. Such notification is issued by Ogra based on the advice of the Federal Government. The category wise consumer gas sale prices/tariff for natural gas reflects various socio-economic policies of the Federal Government, including supply of cheap fuel to households, control of fertilizer prices and promotion of exports. Full cost recovery from end consumers has not been possible from time to time because consumer gas prices were not revised in line with revenue requirements determined by Ogra. Since FY 2015-16, the consumer gas prices were not adequately revised consistent with revenue requirements determined by OGRA. This resulted in accumulation of revenue shortfall/tariff differential amounting to Rs. 547 billion (SSGCL: Rs.245 billion, SNGPL: Rs.301 billion) as of March 2022. This is a major portion of the gas sector circular debt of Rs. 1.232 trillion.  Current consumer gas prices became effective in October, and if prices are kept unchanged, SNGPL and SSGCL would face a combined revenue shortfall of Rs. 165 billion during FY 2022-23, further increasing the circular debt and further straining the ability of the gas importing companies (PSO and PLL) and Exploration and Production Companies (OGDC, PLL, MPCL etc.) to sustain the supply chain and invest in exploration and production. Section 8 (3) of the OGRA Ordinance, 2002 (as amended in March, 2022) (Annex) reads as follows: \u201cThe Federal Government shall, within forty days of the advice referred in sun-section 1 and (2) advise the Authority of minimum charges and the sale price for each category of retail consumer for natural gas for notification in the official Gazette by the Authority of the prescribed price as determined in sub-sections (l) and (2), the minimum charges and the sale prices for each category of retail consumes of natural gas. The federal government shall ensure that the sale prices so advised are not less than the revenue requirement determined by the Authority.\u201d Foregoing in view, Petroleum Division after an analysis of the gas consumer categories, their respective consumption over the past financial year, the impact of change of price on various categories of consumers and the need to meet the revenue requirements of gas utility companies proposes following broad principles/parameters for revision of the category-wise consumer gas sale prices: Domestic consumers: the existing slab structure is proposed to be revised to bring efficiency and progressivity in the provision of subsidy to the domestic consumers.  Following principles form the foundation of this proposal: (i) existing slab structure of 7 slabs is being revised into 5 slabs by consolidating last 2 existing slabs; (ii) slab up to 0.4 hm3 is proposed to be merged with slab up to 0.5 hm3 and the rate for the merged slab is proposed to be Rs. 173/mmbtu from Rs 121/mmbtu. There will be no minimum charge in the domestic category; (iii) no change has been proposed in the price for the slab up to I hm3. It will remain at Rs 300/mmbtu; (iv) the above (i) to (ii) will protect the poorest consumers; (v) preceding slab benefit has been proposed to be maintained up to consumption of 1 hm3. Beyond the threshold of 1 hm3, preceding slab benefit will be discontinued; (vi) the last 2 slabs with highest consumption i.e. consumption up to 3 hm3 and above representing the affluent consumers may pay closest to the average cost of RLNG. The proposed rate will be Rs1,856/mmbtu from existing Rs738/mmbtu (151 per cent increase); (vii)  highest consumption slab may not be allowed the benefit of lower slabs; in order to ensure this, it has been  proposed that if the consumption in any of the preceding eleven months and the billing month exceeds the level of 3 hm3, the rate of the highest slab will be applicable, ie, Rs 3,712/mmbtu existing rate up to Rs 1,460 (335 percent increase);  This mechanism will be applied prospectively with effect from July 1, 2022 in such a manner that the number of preceding months for this calculation will increase from zero to eleven by June, 2023; and (viii) bulk consumers will be charged at the average price prescribed by Ogra. Special Commercial (Roti Tandoor): It has been proposed to consolidate the slabs in this category of consumers because 95% consumers fall in the last slab of existing structure. The rates for the slab above 3 hm3 have been kept equal to the Average Prescribed Price of Ogra. On consumption levels below 3 hm3, the rate is kept at 50% of the said price. The rate for bulk will be Rs 928 / mmbtu from Rs 780/mmbtu and commercial. Special commercial (Roti Tandoor) Rs 928/mmbtu from RS 697 mmbtu.  Commercial consumers: a raise of 81% in existing price has been proposed from Rs 1,283/mmbtu to Rs 2,321/mmbtu, although the alternate fuel for commercial consumers is LPG, which is 4 times the cost of indigenous gas in terms of energy units, however, the proposed raise in price is still much lower than LPG price (58% of LPG price only). General Industry (export & non-export): The export industry (erstwhile zero-rated industry) in Punjab is provided RLNG at subsidized rate of $ 6.5/mmbtu subject to provision of budgeted subsidy. For the next fiscal year, the amount of subsidy allocated for this purpose in the budget is Rs. 40 billion and Finance Division has advised that the rate charged to the export Industry in Punjab may be adjusted accordingly.  Consequently, the existing price of S6.5 /mmbtu has been proposed to be revised to S9/mmbtu. The non-export industry in Punjab is charged the full price of RLNG. On the basis of the above, for indigenous gas being provided to the industries in the other provinces following principles are proposed: (i) captive power and process consumers of non-export industry may be charged at Rs. 1,650/mmbtu from existing rate of Rs 1,87/mmbtu \u2013 ($ 8 mmbtu); and (ii) captive power units and process consumers of export industry may be charged at Rs. 1,450/mmbtu (USS 7/mmbtu). The proposed rate for general industry (non-export) will be Rs 1,650/mmbtu from Rs 1,054/ mmbtu, export- Rs 1,450 mmbtu from Rs 819/mmbtu.  Fertilizer: The price of fertilizer feed did not witness much increase in the past because of its ultimate impact on farmers. The price has been proposed to be around 50% of the Average Prescribed Price whereas the price for fuel gas use has been proposed to be twice of Average Prescribed price, ie, Rs. 1,857/mmbtu. The proposed new rates for feed (Engro) Rs 140/mmbtu from Rs 117/mmbtu, feed (others) Rs 430/mmbtu from Rs302/mmbtu. Fuel Rs 1,857/mmbtu from Rs 1,023/mmbtu. Power: The most efficient plants with over 60% efficiency are operating on imported gas whereas scarce natural gas is being provided at much lower cost to the less efficient power plant. In order to encourage efficiency in the merit order while protecting the pass-on impact to consumer, the existing tariff has been proposed to be equated with Average Prescribed Price. The new proposed rates for power are Rs 928/mmbtu from Rs 857/mmbtu: Liberty power-proposed rate Rs 2,406/mmbtu from Rs1,881/mmbtu.  CNG and Cement: In order to control the consumption of diminishing indigenous gas reserves, CNG and cement sector are lower on the merit order due to the overall consumptions and the fact that most of the CNG stations have shifted to RLNG. Similarly, most of the cement has shifted on alternate fuels or operating on RLNG, therefore, the price has been proposed to be set at Rs.2,321/mmbtu as compared to existing tariff which is 70% and 82% increase over existing CNG and cement price.  There is no change being proposed in the minimum charges of any of the consumer categories except domestic. The proposed rise in gas tariff of various categories of consumers with effect from July 1, 2023 is expected to generate a revenue of Rs. 666 billion (SNGPL: Rs.331 billion, SSGCL: Rs. 335 billion) as against Ogra determined revenue of Rs. 546 billion. Considering the revision in consumer gas sale prices, the resultant surplus revenue estimated to be at Rs. 120 billion would be adjusted by OGRA in the review of prescribed prices of both the gas companies for recovery of prior years\u2019 revenue shortfall respectively. The proposed price increases for power and fertilizer consumers would also be applicable on similar consumers of Mari Petroleum Company Ltd and Pakistan Petroleum Ltd. The Ogra may determine and notify the RLNG sale price under Section 43B of the OGRA Ordinance, 2002 based on the prevalent guidelines issued by the Government from time to time on \u201cSale Price of RLNG\u201d for the RLNG consumers of SSGCL, SNGPL and PLL. During the mid-year review of Estimated Revenue Requirement (ERR) for FY 2023, Ogra may include the cost of RLNG diversion in the determination of Review of Estimated Revenue Requirement (RERR).

All 12 cargoes have been secured at the long-term contract arrangements with Qatar, of which five are priced at a slope of 13.3 percent of Brent, and three at 10.2 percent. Brent averaged $111.5/bbl for the reference period for July 2022 slope calculation \u2013 which is based on average Brent prices of three preceding months. This was the highest Brent average since Pakistan started to import LNG from Qatar under the long-term agreement with Slope at 13.37 percent. The Delivered-Ex-Shipp (DES) import cost at $13.65/mmbtu is lower than last month despite higher Brent slope, due to an additional cargo at the reduced slope of 10.2 percent. This space had highlighted last month that Pakistan\u2019s July LNG import bill may be substantially reduced, largely due to inability to procure cargoes from the spot market. Two consecutive tenders were scrapped as no bidder qualified for July delivery. Peak electricity consumption months of August and September will require more imported gas to keep up with the demand. But the previous tender had no takers, as bids for July and August, amounting to eight cargoes received no interest from the spot market. Nothing suggests that the situation is easing anytime soon, as Europe braces for load shedding of power for winters, despite more and more LNG vessels moving towards the continent. Long-term contracts appear a safer bet, although there are no guarantees of ensured supply.

The recent shortage in fuel for the power sector emerged primarily from the RLNG supply issue when Gunvor backed out of 4 LNG cargo deliveries for April-June to Pakistan. All this has shifted the burden of fuels to furnace oil, which is being consumed at maximum in the power sector despite being lower on the merit order. As a result, the furnace oil stocks with power plants are running low \u2013 creating a shortage to fulfill the rising demand.  Fuel shortage and liquidity issues in the power sector have kept circular debt unabated; subsidies on petrol and diesel amid high oil price scenarios and record depreciation of the currency are signs of a balance of payment crisis. Hard choices lie ahead for the new government on petroleum \u2013 among others.

High speed diesel (HSD) sales reduced by 38 percent on MoM to 444,000 tons, Motor Gasoline (MOGAS) sales declined by 15 percent on MoM to 594,000 tons and Furnace Oil (FO) sales dipped by 23 percent on MoM to 350,000 tons.  Major reasons behind the decline in oil sales are Eid holidays during the first half of July where inter provincial transportation activity subsided which led to low HSD sales, and monsoon season across the country resulted in lower traffic on the roads, Saad Ziker at Topline Securities said.  Furthermore, increase in MOGAS and HSD prices by 26 percent and 41 percent since June 2022 resulted in reduced demand of petroleum products and increase in usage of public transport and car pooling, he added.  As compared to last year, Pakistan oil sales recorded 26 percent on year-on-year decline in July 2022 which is owed to drop in MOGAS and HSD Sales by 27 percent on YoY and 38 percent on YoY, respectively. Excluding FO, oil sales were down 31 percent on YoY and 26 percent on MoM in July 2022 to 1.1 million tons. Among the listed entities, Pakistan State Oil (PSO) sales posted 27 percent on MoM decline to 760,000 tons (lowest since February 2022), mainly due to decline in HSD sales by 38 percent on MoM. In terms of market share, PSO market share clocked in at 53 percent in July 2022 versus 52 percent in July 2021.   Other companies such as Attock Petroleum (APL) and Shell Pakistan (SHEL) also recorded drop of 29 percent on MoM and 37 percent on MoM to 142,000 tons and 100,000 tons, respectively. \u201cWe expect oil sales to drop by 15-20 percent on YoY in FY23E, mainly due to low growth estimated in agriculture sector, likely decline in auto sales and increase in petroleum prices,\u201d Saad Ziker said.

Generating electricity with such expensive fuel comes with extreme complications. The cost of electricity for end consumers is fixed under the Uniform Tariff Regime. However, variations in fuel costs are passed on to consumers through Fuel Charge Adjustments.  Every month, KE and XWDISCOs submit information on the costs incurred to generate electricity for power regulator Nepra\u2019s scrutiny. Following a public hearing, the regulator determines a) the cost to be charged to consumers and b) the month in which this cost will be charged. The petitions filed by Ex-WAPDA Distribution Companies (XWDISCOs) for Fuel Charges Adjustment show how generation costs have risen due to expensive fuel costs. For instance, in the month of April, Wapda generated 1.28 billion units of electricity through natural gas, at a cost of PKR 10.7 billion. In the same month, 2.56 billion units of electricity were generated through imported RLNG at a cost of PKR 41.4 billion.  While the number of units through RLNG were 61% higher than Natural Gas, the cost incurred was almost 286% greater. These costs could have been reduced by providing an adequate allocation of sufficient natural gas to the national power sector, which would also be passed on in benefit to the consumers. Increased fuel costs coupled with a limited supply of natural gas have a ripple effect beyond the National Grid and on KE as well. For the month of April 2022, KE petitioned for a PKR 4.86/unit rise on account of Fuel Charges Adjustment. If the utility had been provided with its allocated natural gas quota, consumers in Karachi would be charged PKR 3.8/unit less. Instead, the available natural gas appears to be routed away from the power sector, creating an artificial dependency on imported fuels.  According to informed sources, the monthly fuel adjustment cost that is collected from consumers on top of the bill is expected to increase exponentially from the current levels of PKR 1 to 4 per unit per month to as high as PKR 10 per unit per month, which will send electricity bills through the roof. Utilities and the Government are also in a financial crunch as fuel prices reach unprecedented highs. The Government has to increase its subsidies to maintain uniform tariffs for consumers but lacks the funds to actually make the payments to utilities. Currently, KE is owed PKR 25 billion in Tariff Differential Subsidies which is pending at various levels at GOP, including Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Energy and NEPRA.  The utility urgently needs this cash to pay SSGC and PSO for fuel supplies. This owed amount is projected to reach PKR 48 billion by June 2022. The lack of funds will make fuel procurement a Herculean task, which in turn will impact the electricity available for Karachi and could cause an extension in the power cuts to the city. To bridge the gap, KE has been borrowing from financial institutions, but even these credit lines are quickly becoming exhausted. The national situation is no better either. In a high level meeting with PM Shehbaz Sharif, Chinese power firms operating in Pakistan said they await payment of PKR 340 billion in outstanding dues which are creating liquidity issues and pushing them to the brink of shutdown. PSO\u2019s subsidy receivables are also projected to hit PKR 60 billion in the last quarter of the fiscal year. An urgent release of these legitimate payments is critical to the sustainability of the power value chain, and all eyes look towards the Government machinery to come through. This is an ugly manifestation of the circular debt crisis that has been lingering since time immemorial. The difference is that it is now threatening the fundamental integrity of the power sector. It is impossible that an overnight solution will be developed to solve the mountains of payables and receivables between entities. But as we enter the last month of the current fiscal year, the government needs to ensure that enough subsidies are released to KE, PSO, and other stakeholders to sustain the sector. Additionally, a bitter pill that the nation must swallow is that if electricity is becoming so expensive, it must be treated as a luxury. Faced with similar messy situations, Sri Lanka resorted to nationwide power cuts of up to 7.5 hours to save costs, a practice that is continuing to some extent today as well. In a recent video interview, former PM Shahid Khaqan Abbasi also shared that one hour of load-shed can actually save the country USD 125 million (or approximately PKR 25.19 billion). As recently as 2021, countries like China were sensitizing citizens on reducing personal consumption. These solutions must be explored in earnest but should not be relied upon to offset the actual issue of clearing subsidy payments on time. It is imperative that we begin searching for a way out while the lights are still on; shooting in the dark has seldom resulted in success.

The RLNG quantity imported in August 2022 is by far the lowest since April 2020, when Covid was peaking. It is also the joint-lowest ever since at least January 2019. No, Pakistan\u2019s requirement has not suddenly gone down, despite emerging signs of slowdown in demand. There just is not enough RLNG available in the spot market, as Europe rushes to bid at exorbitant rates. The fact that Pakistan went all out in procuring LNG at all costs in May 2022 is not lost on anybody, and that strategy has rightly taken the backseat now, with the authorities making a deliberate attempt to keep the balance of payment in check. September 2022 promises to be much of the same, with the previous tender failing to attract any bids for any window of the month. There may or may not be more attempts made to throw another tender for September, but chances of that going through remain very slim. Unless events in the Russia-Ukraine war take a dramatic turn, the lull could well go deep into winters. While it may not be hurting much right now, winters could be tougher due to increased heating demand. The cost itself for August at an average $16.9/mmbtu for SNGPL and $17.5/mmbtu for SSGC is the lowest in four months. For reference, imported LNG cost had surpassed $21/mmbtu in June 2022 excluding GST. This will also bode well for the headache that the monthly power tariff adjustments have become, although, it comes at a cost of forced load management and switching to other thermal fuels. The import bill at around $320 million for August 2022 is now closer to the mean, although the cost remains considerably higher from last year. Pakistan is now attempting to arrange more LNG under long-term 5-year contracts to ensure supply security, with Brent slope agreement, instead of risking it all in the spot market.

At present, oil and gas sectors are reeling from Rs1.6 trillion worth of circular debt whereas the power sector has a circular debt close to Rs2.5 trillion. The rising gas demand forced the previous government, which ran the country from August 2018 to early April 2022, to divert expensive LNG to the residential consumers in winter. However, there was no mechanism in place to recover dues from the domestic sector.  Now, LNG has become a major contributor to the circular debt, leading to deterioration in the financial health of Pakistan State Oil and Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited. PSO has to receive over Rs270 billion from SNGPL on account of LNG supplies whereas SNGPL has to recover around Rs100 billion from the domestic sector, industry players say. The Petroleum Division is set to seek approval of the new government for the provision of Rs26 billion, out of a total of Rs41 billion, to SNGPL to cover the subsidy on LNG supplies to the export-oriented sectors. Apart from the circular debt woes, price differential claims of billions of rupees are emerging because of the freeze on oil price revision while in the international market crude oil has risen to multi-year highs. Already, the consumers in Pakistan are paying record high prices of petroleum products. \u201cWe have to resolve the circular debt issue by revamping the entire power sector, including tariff setting, efficiencies of power generating units, supply chain network and payment recoveries. If this is not done, the future of energy sector would remain at stake,\u201d Anjum Nisar warned.  He said that the power sector problem is a multifaceted problem and the government must avoid increasing the cost further, especially for the industry. He said that the government claimed that it has been making efforts to improve efficiency but the power sector situation remains grim despite putting an additional burden of Rs165 billion on consumers in the past one year by increasing electricity prices. In fiscal year 2021-22, the government provided Rs133 billion less in subsidies as against the requirements based on reduced rate of tariffs for various categories of consumers. The government has recently prepared a plan to reduce the circular debt but the new plan, drawn up in consultation with the International Monetary Fund, shows that the circular debt reduction will largely hinge up increasing the electricity prices. Mian Anjum Nisar said that the issue of circular debt will continue to haunt the government\u2019s resolve of reducing cost of doing business and promotion of industry. The continuous increase in the flow of the circular debt was against the promises of the govt to bring the circular debt to zero. It is going to make another plan to reduce the debt, mainly by increasing electricity tariffs which is not the proper way to handle the issue. The circular debt in June 2018 was Rs1.148 trillion that has jumped to Rs2.327 trillion by June 2021 \u2013 an increase of more than 100 percent in three years of the government. Referring to a report, he said that the government added another Rs72 billion in the circular debt on account of interest payments to the IPPs on delayed payments, which were 31% higher than the preceding year. Similarly, another amount of Rs37 billion was added on account of interest paid on the Power Holding Limited loans, which were 47% less than the previous year. This is despite the fact the consumers are also paying debt servicing surcharge through their monthly bills. FPCCI former President and the BMP Chairman called for power sector reforms, considering the matter of over billing, technical losses, transmission issues, proposal on decentralization of the sector, promotion of off grid solutions, incentives for renewable energy solutions and capacity payments to the independent power producers. He added that if the government failed to take immediate measures the power sector is likely to choke up due to heavy outstanding dues.

The Minister made the said statement last week at Karachi Port terminal where he marked the inauguration of transport of containers by rail - coinciding with the commissioning of a 3.7km, high-tech train track laid at the Karachi Port, connecting the facility to rest of the country in a seamless manner through PR extensive network spread throughout the country.

A comprehensive plan titled \u2018Oil on Rail\u2019 was then rolled out to transport fuel to IPPs under public-private partnership by which the private sector would be the transporter and investor for rolling stock and infrastructure, whereas the railways would rent its tracks at a wheeling fee. Many international investors were keen to invest. Unfortunately, however, the plan was aborted for unknown reasons. PR also has a locomotive refurbishment facility at Risalpur and carriage manufacturing facility at Islamabad. At one time both were put to use. But, no more.

The Privatization Division has set a target to divest 7 percent government shares in the OGDCL and 10 percent in the PPL offered to strategic partners with one seat in the board of directors of these two mega oil and gas companies. \nThe government has estimated to generate Rs 48 billion through divestment of 7 percent (301 million shares) of the OGDCL and another Rs 40 billion from 10 percent (226 million shares) which the Privatisation Division has planned to offer by the end of current financial year. However, no reference prices or discount on shares has been decided yet. \nThe federal government has revised the target of revenue to be generated through privatization of state-owned entities from Rs 150 to Rs 300 billion for current financial year 2019-20. The proceeds of divestment of these shares will be 30 percent of total targeted revenue to be collected through the privatisation in 2019-20. \nThe National Assembly Standing Committee on Privatisation met under the chairmanship of Syed Mustafa Mahmud and discussed in length the privatisation of the OGDCL, PLL, Guddu Power Plant and Nandipur Power Plant. \nSecretary Privatisation Division Rizwan Malik briefed the committee on the status of privatisation of these entities which have been placed in the active list of privatization. \nHe said that the divestment of shares of OGDCL and PPL would be completed by June 2020; however, the sale of two Gencos, Guddu Power Plant and Nandipur Power Plant, would be completed in the first or second quarter of financial year 2020-2021. \nThe secretary said that the Privatization Commission invited expression of interest for appointment of Financial Advisory Consortium and issued request for proposal (RFP) to three interested parties - CLSA Limited, Alfalah Securities and UBL; Credit Suisse, Arif Habib Ltd and AKD Securities; Citi, HBL and Next Capital. Due date for submission of technical and financial proposal is December 09, 2019. \"A strategic partner is required to discover the true profit of its privatization,\" he added. \nThe chief financial officer (CFO) informed the committee that the OGDCL is the market leader in almost all the aspects of up-stream sector including acreage, seismic, reserves and production. The OGDCL is a debt free company, contributing Rs 160 billion to national exchequer. The government of Pakistan holds 74.97 percent interest while 10.05 percent shares are with Benazir Employees Stock Option Scheme. The OGDCL is producing 47 percent of oil and 29 percent of gas out of the total country's production during 2019-20. Its net sale was Rs 261.481 billion and profit after tax was Rs 1,178.3 million during financial year 2018-19. During the fiscal year 2018-19, about 16 wells were drilled including nine exploratory and seven development wells. \nIn his briefing, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of PPL Ihtisham Ahmed said that Privatization Commission Board approved divestment up to 10 percent share of the PPL held by the government to the institutional investors through block sale. The PPL is the pioneer in oil and gas field in the country. It has 10 board members including managing director, four government directors and five independent directors. The government of Pakistan holds 67.5 percent while 7.4 percent shares are held by Benazir Employees Stock Option Scheme and their remaining 25 percent shares have been offered for free float. \nThe Privatisation Commission issued the RFP to two interest parties: CLSA Limited and Alfalah Securities; and Credit Suisse, Arif Habib Ltd and Topline Securities. \nThe committee deferred the remaining agenda regarding Guddu and Nandipur Power Plants and decided that a separate meeting would be convened to get the full spectrum on the detailed discussion. \nEarlier, the secretary privatization said that both the power plants were running into profit of Rs 4 billion which turned into Rs 11 billion loss due to non-adjustment of fuel charges. The matter was under consideration of the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra). \nHe further elaborated that four inquiries related to corruption in Nandipur Power Plant have been pending in the National Accountability Bureau (NAB). \"We don't know how much time the NAB takes to complete the investigation,\" he said. In such scenario, he said, the privatization of these two Gencos is not possible in current financial year.

Member committee Nauman Wazir Khattak alleged that the OGDC Board had selected unqualified executive directors in the company at hefty salaries of around Rs 2 million each and against the policies of the government. \nHe further said that the OGDC Board has failed to appoint a suitable candidate for the post of permanent managing director in last five years due to stay order of the court. \"The board wants to select a person having experience of refinery rather than an exploration expert,\" he alleged. \nThis was the reason that the court has given stay order against the appointment of permanent managing director. \nThe issue of regularizing of 13 engineers appointed under Aghaz-e-Haqooq-e-Balochistan was referred to board of OGDC. These employees were hired on contract basis more than ten years back and have not been regularized. \nThe OGDCL acting MD informed the committee that there were 85 employees who were hired before this package. He said that nine engineers were given job under Aghaz-e-Haqooq-e-Balochistan. He said that the Supreme Court had given a ruling that the employees should be regularized through test and interview. \nActing Managing Director OGDC Dr Naseem Ahemd urged that the management has recently hired three executive directors at a salary of Rs 1.2 million each. He further said that he had no knowledge about the stay on the appointment of managing director by any court. \nThe secretary petroleum emphasized that the energy mix should be reviewed as there is no mismatch in the demand of the re-gasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) by the power sector. He said that in December each year, Petroleum and Power Divisions jointly prepare an annual plan for import of the RLNG to meet the requirement of power and other sectors of the economy. \nHe said the import of RLNG is imperative to meet the deficit of the gas otherwise the country would face gas shortage as it had faced in 2009-10. \nThe director general Petroleum Concession (DGPC), Petroleum Division, said that the indigenous gas production is 4 bcf and requirement of system gas is 6 bcf. The import of LNG stands at 1.2 bcf. \nNauman Wazir said that there is mismatch between the import of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) and demand of power sector. Resultantly, recently the federal government had to halt local gas supply in the system and delivered expensive LNG to power sectors and other consumers by utilizing existing pipelines. \nThe director general Petroleum Concession (DGPC), Petroleum Division, said that the federal government has been paying 12.5 percent royalty on each discovery to the province, whereas 2.5 percent share is given to the province where discovery is made and other 2.5 percent is given to the Government Holding Company (Pvt) Ltd. \nIn his ruling, the chairman called a separate session to discuss in detail the provinces' shares in the oil and gas exploration sector. \nNauman Wazir demanded that KPK OGDCL should be given 25 percent share in oil and gas reserves. However, the secretary petroleum said that the provinces cannot get share in such a way. It was informed that the OGDCL is working on development of 11 new wells of oil and gas.

Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (PSX: OGDCL) also saw its bottomline being impacted as FY20 earnings slipped by 15 percent year-on-year, where most of the decline came from 2HFY20. The squeeze in earnings started from the top as OGDCL\u2019s revenues decreased by 6 percent year-on-year in FY20. The decline was both due to falling crude oil prices and production levels. Realized prices of crude oil witnessed a drop of around 20 percent to $46.76 per barrels whereas LPG realized prices also fell by 11 percent year-on-year to Rs63,997 per ton in FY20. Realized gas prices, however, increased by 16.5 percent to Rs.393.32 per mcf. Production numbers were also subdued as COVID-19 left many fields such as Nashpa, Mela and KAPDTAY in partial shutdown mode. Oil and gas production thus witnessed decline of around 12 percent each in FY20, while LPG production fell by 11 percent.  Despite decline in revenues, the company incurred an increase in operating expenses, which aided the decline in gross profits. Absence of exchange gains restricted other income growth and increase in all expenses including exploration, general administration, and finance cost also impacted the bottomline. Growth in exploration expenses was due to significant cost of dry and abandoned wells during the year; 8 wells were declared dry and abandoned in FY20 versus only two in FY19.

The Cabinet Committee on Privatization (CCoP), in its meeting held on August 21, 2020, approved the proposals of Privatization Commission regarding offloading of 7 and 10 per cent stakes in OGGCL and PPL, respectively. The CCoP further directed the Ministry of Privatization to proceed expeditiously with all privatization transactions. The process may be slow due to market conditions.  . The CCoP, in its meeting held on August 26, 2019 approved the inclusion of ten PSEs (with divestment of up to 10 per cent shares held by GoP) in active privatization list and directed PC to publish expression of interest for hiring of an FA (financial adviser), on case to case basis. Accordingly, PC after conducting due procurement process approved to appoint the FA for divestment of PPL shares on January 28, 2020. While the FA Services Agreement was being negotiated, capital market dynamics changed significantly owing to Covid-19 pandemic. In this regard, a consultative meeting with Secretary, Petroleum Division was held on March 5, 2020 under the chairmanship of Minister for Privatization, wherein, Petroleum Division was requested to submit its views to PC on the matter as per a discussion held in the meeting. Accordingly, Petroleum Division submitted the following suggestions: \"Petroleum Division is of the view that presently the share price trend in the capital market is not conducive for divestment of GOP's shares from OGDCL and PPL. Further, the documented mode of divestment is time consuming and not likely for the transaction closure completion during the current financial year 2019-20. As such, Petroleum Division would recommend that divestment of GOP's share from OGDCL and PPL may be deferred for next .financial year 2020- 21 depending upon the share price trend in the capital market. Accordingly, Privatization Commission may consider divestment of GOP's share up to 10% and 18.39% from OGDCL and PPL to strategic investors during the financial year 2020-21 to attract Foreign Direct Investment and introduction of latest expertise in the E&P sector for the benefit of the country.\" PC carried out a divestment of 5% shares of PPL in June 2014 at a share price of Rs.219 ($ 2.22/share). A closer look at the recent trend reflect volatility with a low of Rs.69 ($0.43/share) at end of March 2020 and is being traded around Rs 99 ($0 0.59/share) on August 10, 2020. One of the prime reasons for a big dip in the share price of E&P sector is the historically lowest prices of crude oil in the international market. The matter, including the Petroleum Division's suggestion was discussed in the Privatization Board meeting held on July 22 and 29, 2020 and the PC Board, after thorough deliberations approved and recommended for divestment of up to 10 per cent of GoP's shares in PPL followed by divestment up to 7 per cent of GoP's shares in OGDCL through public offering. Petroleum Division submitted that current per share value of OGDCL is far below the earlier offered divestment price of Rs.216 in 2014. They also expressed that \"being the Administrative Division of OGDCL they feel it incumbent to request that the PC review the ongoing process and not resort to selling the GoP's 7% share in OGDCL at this stage\". Petroleum Division proposed that: (i) given the current price of OGDCL 's share which is being traded at very low value, the ongoing divestment of GoP's 7% share in OGDCL may not be processed at this stage; and (ii) PC may consider that the transaction is structured in instead of 7% GoP's shareholding in OGDCL, GoP 's 10% shares, may be offered to a Strategic Investor Company, preferably to a well-versed oil & gas sector exploration and  development company which would bring best industry practices and knowledge, state of the art exploration and production technique in the larger interest of OGDCL and E&P sector in Pakistan.\" On August 21, 2020,   Ministry of Privatization apprised that OGDCL's share posted highest Rs.276 in December 2013 and post December 2014 has not exceeded Rs.200 mark. A closer look at the recent trend reflects a value of very high volatility with a low of Rs.77 at the end of quarter in March 2020 which was recently traded at around Rs. 115. PC Board in its meeting held on July 29, 2020 considered the proposal submitted by the Petroleum Division to attract investment from international E&P companies  in OGDCL by increasing the divestment of government owned shares upto 10 per cent instead of earlier decision of upto to 7 per cent. The Board was of the view that it will not be a viable option for the strategic E&P companies to acquire proposed percentage of shares in OGDCL, as still they would not be in a position to take strategic decisions. PC Board also observed that the shares of OGDCL are being traded at low price, as compared to the price prevailing at offerings in the past couple of years. The Board also gave due consideration to OGDCL's high dividend yield ratio, crude oil prices in international markets and a recent farming out decision by an international E&P company operating in Pakistan. The Board after due deliberations did not endorse the Petroleum Division's proposal to increase the divestment of shares from the earlier approved decision of CCoP upto 7 per cent and decided that divestment of OGDCL shares should not exceed this limit. The PC Board also directed the Transaction Committee to consider documented or undocumented mode for public offering at the time of hiring the FA. Furthermore, it was recommended by the PC Board that divestment of OGDCL and PPL transactions may be planned with reasonable in-between time to make them successful. The CCoP, in its meeting held on August 21, 2020 has directed Ministry of Privatization to go ahead with the process of divestment of up to 07 % of GOP's shares in OGDCL, after the divestment of PPL's shares as directed/recommended by the PC Board.

This has been especially true and present during the times of Covid when many people started working form home and we provided the tools that helped businesses remotely, without disruptions. For example, through our ARIBA procurement software, Pakistan\u2019s hospitals were able to connect with global suppliers providing equipment like ventilators and help save lives in a cost-efficient manner during the height of the pandemic.  In Pakistan, we are present in every possible industry. For instance, the local automobile manufacturing plants are working on SAP solutions. We are also providing software to major steel manufacturers. The manufacturers of local foods & beverages \u2013 from biscuits to spices \u2013 are also using SAP solutions in different domains. Many local banks, Disco\u2019s and telco\u2019s are using our software solutions. The government of Pakistan is also using our software. Many educational institutions are also using our services, and our engagement with online education has increased during the pandemic. We also work with international development institutions, with the aim to improve compliance-related issues like public-sector budgetary controls and AML/CFT monitoring. We carry the experience of helping both the private sector and the public sector in Pakistan. We also provide analytics solutions and software to maximize efficiency and capacity of human resource management.   While (globally) we do, in fact, serve the large corporations and over 90 percent of the Fortune 500 companies are SAP customers, the fact of the matter is that approximately 80 percent of our customers are small- to medium-sized businesses. As for Pakistan, we have different solution categories in the market. For instance, our A-1 solution caters large industries and companies, including the financial sector. Then we have our Business One solution, which caters specifically to SMEs, and even lower general business market. These solutions cost in the range of $1,000 to $20,000, which is affordable in the down market. Let me give you a few examples. Student Biryani is using SAP, and this is not really a company at the scale of the Engro\u2019s or the KE\u2019s of Pakistan. SAP also provides different kinds of cloud solutions to the SME market as well.   Our engagement with the SMEs is mostly indirect in nature. We work with them through our partners, such as IBM, PWC, EY, Siemens, Abacus, Excellence Delivered, etc. We do transactions with SMEs through these partners. Overall, I believe we are serving about 1,000+ SMEs in Pakistan.   The main insight in the SME market is that it is not the software per se that is critical but the training that the SMEs need to get to operate that software. Therefore, if an SME has already invested in some ERP software, the new software company making the pitch should still be able to offer its HR, procurement, marketing solutions on top of that ERP, instead of insisting an end-to-end deployment. That helps an SME make the best use of an existing investment. We, at SAP, provide that flexibility. We are interoperable with other ERPs. And this is our competitive advantage in this market. We work with all kinds of software.  What the SMEs need the most is to adopt best business practices, for which a software product can prove beneficial. About 80 percent of a software requires no changes and can work best for any firm within an industry, and the rest, 20 percent, is where you need to make some changes to suit the firm\u2019s circumstances. SMEs need to change their way of doing business, and not the other way round where a firm expects a software to be customized as per the way the firm has worked for many years.   Before Covid-19, digital transformation was already happening in different industries, from large enterprises to medium and small entities. But they were working on their own pace, depending on a particular industry\u2019s pace and a particular business\u2019s speed. Some were fast in their digital transformation journeys, some were slow, and some were intermittent. However, since Covid-19 has hit, I believe that there is now a universal realization that the transformation to digital solutions and services has become essential for businesses to survive, let alone thrive. The companies that were already in the midst of this transformation were able to do it faster during the pandemic, realizing the impact on social and economic lives. Question is how to embark on this digital journey for rest of the organizations that have now realized the need for transition but do not know the best way to move forward.  There are two kinds of streams \u2013 internal and external. Internally, our Young Professional Program takes 80 to 90 people, trains them for free in different certifications so these young professionals can then go into the market and make careers for themselves in government and private sector. Another initiative, SAP Academy Graduate Program, sends top Pakistani graduates to Silicon Valley and then they come back to work for SAP Pakistan.  Externally, we do not regulate the certification ecosystem, but we do guide its development and best practices. We can only control the software and the education that software can provide to the people in the market. We cannot control quality or costs of these certification centers because these are independent entities who charge on their own. We try to educate them, but pricing is one area not in our control. Sometimes we get complaints directly from individuals, after which we review the feedback and then take corrective actions against certification providers against whom there is a pattern or high number of complaints. Some universities are starting SAP Diploma Programs, and we are helping the academia in that regard. Going forward, we would like that some form of training becomes part of the curriculum at some level.   It is a mix of global structure and Pakistan-specific structure. SAP Pakistan reports to the sub-region, which is called \u201cMiddle East North\u201d that eventually reports to EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), and also to the HQ. On top of that, we have our industry and solution focus as well, where we have experts in both domains working for us. We have separate teams focusing on large enterprises and the SME market. Our internal structure is designed such that we have different targets for large enterprises and SMEs. Three and a half years ago, SAP identified Pakistan as a growth area in the region and later they started investing heavily in Pakistan. As a result, from a team of 5 people, we have now grown to an organization of 60 people in that time frame.   We expanded mainly from a human resource perspective. We got new office setups in Islamabad and Karachi. We were careful to take care of two things before we started growing our setup in Pakistan. First, we started hiring those IT professionals who were themselves well-versed in SAP solutions and their implementation purely in the Pakistani context. And second, we also hired people who were in the different industries, who probably did not know much about SAP but who knew very well the pain points of different industries in Pakistan. So, we hired both these kinds of professionals and then put them together under one roof to take a better shot at the market. This whole concept has really worked for us. Our target market focus in the domestic market was mainly in areas of public sector, oil and gas, telco\u2019s, financial sector, and manufacturing. As a result, we have made breakthroughs with organizations like OGDCL, KE, Engro, etc.  We work on all different models that exist in the ecosystem of any software company. We provide subscription model and cloud model on different services. We provide different revenue-sharing models as well, which are more suitable for some industries than others. We also provide solutions on non-SAP clouds and data centers. We do small deals starting from $1,000 for our SAP Business One software, and also do large deals on A-1 software going all the way beyond $1 million. We have solutions for all segments, and we provide all kinds of pricing models.

But at what prices? This is the real issue we have been facing for the past many years. The general multilateral view is that while the poorest segment of the population should be protected, everyone else should be charged the true cost of service. I have a different viewpoint: there is no doubt that the poorest should be subsidized like consumers below 300 units of electricity are being given. But what about those consuming above 300 units? The objective should be to reduce the cost of power generation so that electricity is affordable for everyone while providing targeted subsidy to the poorest segment of the population. At a high price of electricity, you cannot achieve increased consumption or wealth creation or even compete with your neighbors and peers in the region.   Negotiations have started to convert MoUs into amended and legally binding contracts. The issue now is around payment. The government has to pay Rs450 billion dues of the IPPs out of which around Rs100 billion can be offset against what they owe to PSO, OGDCL and other government entities as well as compensate for Late Payment Surcharge (LPS). What we propose to them is a standard formula - pari passu for all the power plants. However, what they want is differential treatment based on e.g. aging, power policy, government versus private ownership etc.  The reason why we have resorted to the simplest approach of treating everyone equal is to avoid unwanted peculiarities and distortions. What we have offered them is one third payment of the net due with the remaining to be paid over the next two to three years in the shape of promissory notes from the State Bank of Pakistan.  Some IPPs could be a buyout opportunity for us. HUBCO is a good example. Khalid Mansoor of HUBCO along with his legal team has proposed the federal government to buy it out at Rs65 billion. The government owes Rs260 billion next year as capacity payments for the next seven years to HUBCO that operated at only one percent of its capacity the entire year. So, buying it out is a tempting idea.  But I have floated another proposal to them where we have offered to provide them liquidity of Rs65 billion if they convert their two FO units on Thar coal for generating 600 MW for K-Electric; and also install the water desalination plant to provide 300 million gallons per day water to Karachi. It will be a win-win situation for everyone as HUBCO has already signed an MoU with K-Electric for providing 600 MW, and the government will be able to offload its liability of Rs260 billion by just paying Rs65 billion. Also, it will reduce the burden on us to provide electricity to K-Electric. HUBCO management liked the idea; let\u2019s see how this progresses forward.  KAPCO\u2019s PPA is expiring in June 2021. KAPCO plant\u2019s location in Muzaffargarh is strategic and necessary for system stability. Plus, the plant runs on all three fuels: gas, furnace oil and diesel and had a much higher load factor of 42 percent during the year.  We have offered them a hybrid model for the next 5-7 years with both take-or-pay and take-and-pay mode, plus we have allowed wheeling. We have more negotiations lined up, but this is the progress so far and we have time until June next year to finalize things.  The biggest elephant in the room in this IPP discussion however are those under CPEC project. Lucky has sent us a good, revised proposal which talks about Rs200 billion worth of savings over the term of the contract. I would say that Mohammed Ali Tabba has stepped up as the first IPP to make an unofficial and unilateral offer that the government is reviewing right now.  It is time for banks to step up too. Our next discussion in this IPP issue is going to be with the banks on extending their front loading and debt tenor and decreasing their margins. These will address the immediate cash flow problems.  I don\u2019t think that the debt side of the renegotiation will happen before February 12, which is our deadline for converting our MoUs into legally binding contracts.  However, I believe that by June 2021, we would have progress on both the equity and the debt side.   This is what we have in the bucket list in terms of renegotiating the PPAs to reduce the circular debt. Renegotiating the CPEC projects will require renegotiating at geopolitical level, which has not started yet. Prime Minister is very clear that this needs to be done.   There are two views on it.  First, everyone agrees that reforms are necessary. However, the other view is that the DISCOs even on the priority list won\u2019t get privatized at least in the next three years.  I have floated a public-private partnership model for DISCOs at the provincial government level because technology can only go so far. You need local administration to have skin in the game. However, we face a political resistance here. In our three-year plan we are proposing that the federal government will keep 51 percent ownership while the provincial government will have 49 percent stake.  And then we will have a private sector operator to whom we wont sell equity but only the management contract \u2013 selected through bidding. For every percentage decrease in T&D loss or increase in revenue, the contractor will share an \u2018x\u2019 percentage in revenue. That is the model that I want to test in at least two DISCOs next year if I get a nod from the cabinet. My intention is to start with Punjab. This is the only model that I believe will give provinces a sense of ownership as well as responsibilities\u2013 all other measures are cosmetic. Once this model is applied to the DISCOs in the next three years, the next step would be to privatize them. In parallel, you continue to do what needs to be done in terms of governance and board setup.  Nepra Act is stuck in the parliament\u2019s standing committee for two fundamental reasons: One is the automaticity principle that it gives to pricing be it for the monthly charge, quarterly charge, annual rebasing etc. The second is the carte blanche it gives the government to impose surcharges as long as they are related to the power sector.  Is the executive in any emerging market willing to seep control on the pricing of an essential service like electricity? Does the executive have the right to impose any surcharge? Both these principles are correct as per the book. The principle of automaticity as well as World Bank and the IMF say that the executive should be in the business of deducing prices by controlling inflation, having a better energy mix, prioritizing power in gas consumption policy etc. and the tariff determined should be completely passed onto the consumers.  Also, it is the right of the executive to impose surcharge. But both these decisions are difficult from the political perspective. NEPRA is also now playing an active role to protect the consumer and the industry, which is resulting in some tension between the two \u2013 which I believe is a fundamental and a healthy debate between the policy/executive side and the regulator side around the Nepra Act. While there is always a focus on passing on the cost to the consumer, very little insistence is on controlling costs. In my view, if there is an extra cost, we have to pass it on. But at the same time, we have to work to reduce the existing cost for example, though efficiency and performance and addressing cost of generation, leakages in the transmission and distribution system etc. because these are all getting added to the tariff.   I believe there should be a holistic plan for the power sector for the next three years that is credible, sustainable, financeable, and actionable and reduces circular debt over the three-year period. We can then sell it to the Prime Minister and the cabinet and then eventually to the IMF. We have had the same discussion with Dr. Hafeez Sheikh, who is confident that the IMF will come again. Though part of it has to do with the global pandemic, generally the multilaterals are frustrated with the pace of our reforms. Reforms are in our own interest because that would unleash the capital flows in the country; the challenge is to come up with a plan which would be part and parcel of the IMF earlier prescription. We are having such discussion in bits and pieces, but a comprehensive discussion is the need of the hour.   There are a few clear points that should be part of the circular debt management plan. IPP renegotiation will be one of them. Second is the DISCO reforms. Third is the demand growth via industrial support, electrification, etc. Fourth is shutting down our inefficient old generating plants. Then comes the staggering capacity additions in the next wo years to buy some breathing space.  K-Electric issue must also be resolved, which adds to the circular debt. Then there are smaller issues like complete solarization of tube wells in Balochistan and disconnection from the grid which also has political repercussions.  Another way is privatization of some assets, e.g. we are working on a proposal of debt restructuring of the two 1200MW RLNG plants, because I believe that equity selling is not feasible at this time due to many reasons including Covid. Getting the public debt of the two RLNG plants refinanced through local banks will create fiscal space in the power sector. Another proposal I have is a receivable-for-equity swap between companies like PSO and some GENCO. Of course, at the end there is tariff increase. So, there are series of steps that need to be taken; there is no magic wand or one solution to address the circular debt crisis.  One way to do it is what the government has already done \u2013 announcing the industrial support package, and we are hopeful that the numbers would show positive results in a month or two. We are all hoping that this would lift GDP growth, which should increase electricity demand in tandem. Historically, our electricity growth to GDP ratio stands at less than one \u2013 around 0.75. Normally in emerging markets, it is on average 1.2, which means for every one percent increase in GDP, the electricity consumption goes up by 1.2 percent. De-industrialization and captive power are two major reasons for this low ratio in Pakistan.  Another way to increase demand via electricity is to migrate captive power plants using gas to the national grid. This also makes sense because we are scarce on gas now, but we have enough electricity to meet the energy needs. Gas as feedstock or raw material cannot be replaced. But when it comes to energy source, we can give cheaper electricity to industries, but we cannot afford to give cheaper gas for electricity generation. The gas pricing signal for non-process has not happened yet, but it needs to be done for a scarce resource. 80 percent of the captive power plants are connected to the national grid as backup.   On the domestic side, we need to remove the peak and off-peak distinction to spur demand for electrification. All this boils down to reducing the cost of power generation. Only then we can increase demand for electricity.   I was the architect of that policy which then became a national policy. However, I oppose it now. Though it sends the right signal to consumers, it cannot be a permanent policy 10 years later. We all know that it is a form of collective punishment and a clear but temporary policy toolkit for us. I have no hesitation in saying that it cannot be a permanent feature. The distribution companies need to work harder, smarter, and employ technology. Do we have the political will to zero-in on the actual defaulters and thieves? That remains to be tested. I would also say that I\u2019m in favor of revoking this policy.   From smart grid to automatic metering to AMI, the technology is available. It\u2019s a question of cost: who installs it and who pays for it. The ADB\u2019s Project, Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) for two DISCOs: LESCO and IESCO worth $400-500 million has become controversial because of its high cost. What I believe is workable is to restrict advanced metering to the PMT level. This essentially narrows down the 2000 consumer circle of a grid to 200-250 consumers on a PMT. Going below PMT level become ridiculously expensive. A Chinese proposal through CPEC, which is close to what ADB proposes is to recover the cost through a surcharge in the tariff. Another option practiced worldwide is sharing the loss reduction. But at the end, it depends on the cost.

According to M/s Pakistan Petroleum Limited gas production from the Dhok Sultan X-1 had increased to 5.0 MMCFD and requested for an additional gas allocation to third party from Dhok Sultan X-1 during the EWT period in view of the existing infrastructure of Dhok Sultan Field, from where, 0.9 MMCFD associated gas was already being supplied to third party at a negotiated price through competitive bidding. Ministry of Energy has approved the extension in EWT over Dhok Sultan X-l discovery till expiry of appraisal program i.e.  February 28, 2021 subject to the following conditions: (i) in no event, such EWT production shall cause loss of revenues for the Government;(ii) M/s PPL will submit DoC/ Field Development Plan over said discovery before expiry of EWT production period;(iii)   production taken under EWT arrangement would be accounted for cumulative, production for payment of production bonus upon commercial production.

The injection of around 5-6 MMSCFD gas in SNGPL network would require installation of a proper gas processing facility to sell on-spec gas and construction of approximately 30 - 35 km pipeline in a hilly / rugged terrain (gas injection point Dhalcni). M/s SNGPL had reported that specifications provided by the M/s PPL for the gas are not complying with OGRA's approved Natural Gas Quality Limits, hence it  cannot be accepted by SNGPL without processing. According to M/s PPL, the gas being off-specification, requiring processing and laying of approximately 35 km pipeline during EWT period also requires capital expenditure as well as lead time of 20-28 months. Therefore, considering the associated reservoir and volumetric uncertainties, M/s PPL has requested for 5.0 MMCFD gas allocation to third party from Dhok Sultan X-1 during the EWT period Ministry of Energy proposed that upto 5.0 MMCFD gas from Dhok Sultan X-1 may be allocated to MIS PPL for sale to third party through competitive bidding in a transparent manner during EWT period or till installation of processing plant and pipeline after which the processed gas would stand allocated to SNGPL to meet its deficit in gas supply and demand. Meanwhile, M/s PPL would initiate necessary arrangements for improving the quality of gas for formal allocation to M/s SNGPL and would ensure the completion of the required arrangements well before 28 months timeline.

A government team comprising Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives, Asad Umar, Minister for Energy, Omar Ayub, SAPM on Petroleum, Nadeem Babar and Nepra's team headed by its Chairman Tauseef H. Farooqi have already held a meeting with Chief Justice Supreme Court, Justice Gulzar Ahmed and Justice Ijaz-ul-Ahsan in the chamber of Chief Justices on November 12, 2020 and briefed them about the issues related to KE. Attorney General of Pakistan has also convened a meeting of all concerned stakeholders on Monday (today) to evolve consensus on an out of box solution of KE issues, to be presented to the SC. The sources said, Shanghai Electric is seeking to acquire KE subject to the following four conditions: (i) settlement and resolution of the payment of dues to SSGC and NTDC / CPPA and receipt of dues from KWSB and the Federal Government on the basis of reciprocity for any interest payments; (ii) determination of the mid-term review of the Multi Year Tariff (MYT) by NEPRA; (iii) determination of claims under various components of the KE tariff by NEPRA and; (iv) exclusivity right afforded to KE is maintained, as per the licence. \"KE needs to be made viable to provide electricity to Karachi as required and to be sold to Shanghai Electric,\" the sources said, adding that Shanghai Electric's acquisition of KE remains on the table, but with new management in China, progress has to involve KE shareholders and GoP agreeing to Shanghai Electric's clear preconditions to complete the transaction so that Shanghai Electric can make investments in KE that they committed over four years ago. KE claims that the presence of Shanghai Electric represents a current opportunity of ensuring that KE achieves the required 100 percent growth in power supply in the next 15 years. KE is involved in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in Karachi, Dhabeji, Gharo (Sindh) and Utthal, Vinder and Bela (Balochistan), including all government & public departments. In the next 15 years just Karachi's energy requirements are expected to increase by 100 percent. The GDP of just Karachi represents 25 percent of the GDP of Pakistan, therefore, more than 25 percent of Pakistan's GDP depends on power supplied by KE. KE claims that it also services loss-making areas, where consumers do not pay bills. These are Katchi Abadis, slums, and some of the poorest localities in Karachi, Sindh and Balochistan. The losses caused to KE by servicing of loss-making areas are almost Rs17 billion annually, but working with the community, KE has improved theft and recovery losses by 17 percent in 10 years. In a presentation, the power utility has claimed that recovery ratio improved by 3.5 percent points, distribution capacity increased by 25.6 percent in last 5 years, whereas power sector owned by the government's recovery ratio improved by 2.2 percent points and distribution capacity increased by 12.3 percent in last 5 years. Feeder overloading was 22.9 percent (2020). KE's expected milestones as per approved business plan till 2023 will be as follows: (i) move to power surplus position through addition of 900 MW RLNG plan, off-take of additional supply of 1,400 MW from national grid. For elimination of load-shedding, conversion of all high and very high loss PMTs to Aerial Bundled Cable (ABC). The power utility argued that Nepra's approval of investment and regulatory certainty are the pre-conditions to achieve the targets. \"Nepra's approval of claims filed under MYT to ensure viability and sustainability is critical for KE to raise financing of Rs170 billion to be financed through debt or planned projects in three years,\" the sources added. Resolution/ settlement of dues including mark-up is necessary. KE cannot ensure the uninterrupted supply of energy without the cooperation of NEPRA, NTDC, SSGC/PSO etc. and the Federal Government. KE has further claimed that it owes a principal amount of Rs13.7 billion to SSGC against payment of gas supply. Similarly, KWSB, which is defined as a strategic consumer under the Implementation Agreement (IA), owes a principal amount of PKR 28.3 billion to KE, which is not disputed by the Federal Government. KE has been unable to make such payment because it has failed to receive Rs28.3 billion from KWSB. Under the Implementation Agreement, the Federal Government was responsible for paying KWSB's dues to KE. It was proposed that an adjustment be made between KE, KWSB and SSGC by the Federal Government. Despite negotiating an adjustment, the Federal Government has repeatedly failed to implement such adjustment mechanism. Thus, the principal amounts due from KWSB and KE remain outstanding. SSGC has been charging an excessive and compounding interest on the principal amount owed by KE, which now amounts to PKR 93 billion, while KE did not charge any interest on its receivables, including from the Federal Government. Due to SSGC's insistence on charging excessive and compounding interest and due to KE not charging any interest, KE is at a considerable disadvantage. As previously adjudged by the Federal Government, KE is and has always been willing to pay the principal amount to SSGC upon receipt of the principal amount from KWSB. NTDC / CPPA have a receivable of a principal amount of PKR 143.8 billion from KE. The Federal Government owes KE Rs200.7 billion in Tariff Differential Claims (TDCs). KE has not charged any interest on the principal amount receivable from the Federal Government. NTDC / CPPA have charged interest of PKR 55 billion on KE's payables due to the Federal Government's failure to make timely payments to KE. A set-off mechanism is already agreed between NTDC / CPPA and KE under which the payables of the Federal Government may be set off directly against the receivables of NTDC / CPPA. The Federal Government has failed to set-off the entire amount in a timely manner. The Federal Government has previously successfully set-off amounts under this mechanism. As a result, KE has been subjected to interest and has been deprived of the ability to invest up to Rs200 billion in its infrastructure. KE is of the view that in case the payment of interest, compounded or simple, is chargeable to KE in respect of Rs13.7 billion due from KE the latter should similarly be entitled to charge compounded or simple interest on Rs28.3 billion due from KWSB to KE. In such a case, interest will be paid ultimately by the Federal Government on behalf of KWSB to KE. KE will thereafter make interest payments to SSGC. SSGC will further make such interest payments to OGDCL and ultimately to the Federal Government. In effect, therefore, the payment of any interest on due principal amounts will be made by the Federal Government through KWSB and received by it through SSGC, representing a payment by GoP to GoP. However, in the case interest is charged, the Federal Government will be required to allocate or borrow precious funds to make interest payments on behalf of KWSB, only to receive the same after a long cycle through SSGC. The KE further argues that NEPRA is obligated to determine the multi-year tariff, however despite significant delays and over 2 years of finalisation process, NEPRA failed to determine a sustainable tariff. Additional NEPRA approvals for KE's investment plan for the next 3 years under the tariff Mid-Term Review are also pending for over 30 weeks. Delay in these determinations has adversely impacted KE's viability including borrowings to finance expansions. \"When utility bills are not paid it is recorded as a loss to KE which is currently at around Rs17 billion per year. NEPRA has allowed KE to claim prudent costs under the NEPRA Act. Despite a continuing lapse of more than a year, these claims remain pending,\" the sources maintained. KE filed its externally audited claims for the losses and costs for the last 3 years of about Rs14 billion out of the Rs50 billion recovery loss suffered by KE. This amount of Rs14 billion was to be incorporated in tariffs and thus not be a loss for KE. Due to the non-determination of these claims by NEPRA, KE will effectively suffer additional losses of upto Rs20 billion annually simply due to NEPRA's failure to undertake its own claim mechanism. NEPRA granted KE exclusivity by way of a distribution license dated July 21, 2003 which was to be for 20 years and ends in July, 2023. This was a key pillar of privatisation and incentive to incoming investors to plan their commitments. The power utility has claimed that it made its investments and plans in reliance of the legal representation made by NEPRA in respect of exclusivity in the licence, adding that NEPRA seeks to modify such exclusivity before 2023, it does not provide for any alternative plan or policy for servicing Karachi's needs, including its loss-making areas. On exclusivity, KE says that exclusivity is a material consideration for Shanghai Electric in its bid for KE. In the case Shanghai Electric abandons its acquisition of KE, NEPRA will be jeopardising the provision of electricity to Karachi in the future. KE, in its prayer has requested that the Supreme Court may order to do so on the basis of principal amounts payable and not on the basis of simple or compounding interest as the same has not been charged by KE to KWSB as guaranteed by GoP. Supreme Court may do away with the interest, and its net loss to the Federal Government and direct the Federal Government to set off the claims payable by it to KE against the claims receivable by NTDC / CPPA. KE has further requested the SC to direct the Federal Government to thereafter finalise an agreement between KE and NTDC / CPPA for additional power to satisfy the requirements of Karachi. The power utility has also prayed that Supreme Court may require NEPRA to determine multi-year tariff adjustments including investment plans under the mid term review immediately and to allow the same to be viable. SC may require NEPRA to determine KE's claims under the MYT to ensure the viability of KE and enable execution of required investment.

But while the country\u2019s power sector woes are much talked about, far less is debated about the natural gas sector despite it mirroring all the ills of power sector. For example, distribution losses in the Power Sector are approximately 18% (equivalent to Rs. 45 Billion per annum, over NEPRA allowance) which are twice that of international norm, whereas UFG equivalent of direct losses is 14% (Rs. 105 billion per annum, over and above OGRA allowance), which is 7 times that of international norm. Natural gas resources, which currently contribute 50% to Pakistan\u2019s total energy supply, are declining rapidly with no sizeable gas discoveries in sight in tandem with inefficient use of indigenous natural gas. As per Council of Common Interest (CCI), severe shortages of gas have been predicted in the coming years. A shortage of roughly 500 MMcfd is expected during the winters of 2020-2022, virtually shutting down the industry for 2 \u2013 3 months and severely contracting economic output. The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) prediction of a contraction of Pakistan\u2019s GDP by 0.40% in 2020 comes as no surprise. If economic growth is to become a national priority, the direct and indirect effects of the natural gas crisis must be assessed while simultaneously formulating a timely and efficient long-term action plan. This article is aimed at highlighting some of the sector\u2019s key challenges which would come to lie at the heart of such a reform agenda. Let us begin by analyzing demand and supply trends over the past few years as well as projections for the same. On the supply side, gas reserves have been on the decline in Pakistan (see Figure1) and very little exploration activities are taking place and are not likely reap benefits before at least 5 years. And while several natural gas fields have been discovered since mid-2015 and are being further examined for viability, no production timeline is scheduled yet. On the demand side both consumers and production sectors have contributed to a continuing and rapid rise. For instance, the addition of 0.5 million new consumers in 2018-19 will increase the gap in demand and supply, especially in winter, further aggravating gas load shedding and disputes over allocation. As evident, in the face of rising needs by consumers and businesses and declining reserves, supply is not sufficient to meet demand. Resultantly, severe shortages have emerged since 2007 and while they were initially confined to winters when there is a spike in gas use for heating purposes, the shortfall now extends all year round. As per World Bank (WB) estimates, gas shortages of nearly 1,800 MMcfd were witnessed in FY2015 (see Figure 2).  Given these grim circumstances, future outlook is no better as shortages are expected to rise to 3,684 MMcfd in the next five years (FY 2024-25) and to 5,389 MMCFD in the course of the next decade (FY 2029-30), as is evidenced in the projections provided in Table 1. To put things in perspective, the shortage is nearly three times the country\u2019s existing gas shortfall and at least a 100% additional required over current domestic production. A natural enquiry at this point then is the concoction of factors that have fueled gas shortages in recent years.  , the government\u2019s chronic inability to accurately assess demand as well as contain it over the years serves as a primary reason for shortages. This exponential rise over the last 3 decades in gas consumption can be attributed to at least two factors: (i) the government\u2019s shortsighted policies, planning and operations: a decade ago, when industries and automobiles shifted from oil to gas, policymakers failed to estimate the demand-supply gas arising from the shift, and (ii) the government\u2019s gas allocation and consumer gas pricing policy. These policies are (largely) discretionary and provide significant power to the decision-makers, creating avenues for vested interests and pressure groups to advocate and achieve their own goals. The current government is burdened with financial burden of Circular Debt amounting Rs. 350 billion contributed by SNGPL and SSGC by keeping low gas tariffs for maximum political gain \u2013 not passing the OGRA determined pricing (Under 2012 Petroleum Policy) to people \u2013 resulting in increased demand and consumption, or rather misuse of gas, and providing RLNG to domestic users. However, OGRA has taken some steps in rationalizing the tariffs including increasing of tariffs and lowering of unaccounted for gas (UFG) benchmarks. Although the heightened tariffs must look out for vulnerable and lifeline consumers that cannot afford the gas even at low pricing. A two-pronged solution to this lower tariff for lifeline and lower category users is that i) tariff must be set on a cost-of-service basis for an efficient and reliable gas sector, and ii) direct subsidy like BISP \u2013 an effective instrument \u2013 must be embedded to protect the poor household consumers. Gas prices in Pakistan are low and supplies inefficiently allocated, encouraging higher demands - the weighted-average purchase cost for wellhead gas was estimated at $3.50 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) for FY 2017, 10% higher than those in India and almost double than those in Bangladesh. This results in economic waste in terms of welfare loss where consumers are willing to pay more for steady supply of gas, and reduced profits for producers where they can charge higher prices. Moreover, the government implements a uniform gas price for each consumer category across the country regardless of the distance, volume, or cost of supply, further highlighting its inefficiency. Another area where the inefficiencies curtailing the resourceful development of gas sector is the overall revenue structure of both Sui companies where the sector is highly regulated with all aspects have been under one control and creating monopolies. The operations \u2013 pipeline, marketing, gas supply \u2013 are managed by SNGPL and SSGC, whereas deregulation of structure in separating the pipeline business from the sale business will eventually uplift the efficiency of complete supply chain. Since, the departments are highly politicized, all gas supply schemes are politically motivated including the gas exploration initiatives only a decade ago. There were roughly 22 foreign companies with vested interest for new avenues in upstream activities of Pakistan, are now left with only 3 - The management of upstream gas concessions have remained a bottleneck to increased gas supplies. Politically induced allocations and monopolistic business operations are all administrative bottlenecks that have handicapped foreign companies to reap the benefits of our resourceful land. A lot of basin studies have pitched Pakistan gas potential at roughly 10 times the reserves currently discovered. Realization of the yet to be discovered reserves depends upon concerted efforts, openness, a market-based pricing system and Progressive Petroleum Exploration Policy. We are confident that with modern techniques and a strong will, gas discoveries can boost availability of domestic gas in the medium term ~ 5 years by about 50% of current production. For this to happen, the monolithic OGDC and the lethargic PPL need to be shaken, and exploration needs to be reorganized on modern managerial and effective structures.  The wellhead prices are not the only factor for low exploration in Pakistan, there are other countries where the prices are even low but exploration are still taking place. Moreover, as stated earlier, the Division controls the entire structure, for example, one needs a permission for even well-commencement. This approach of holding all operations in one control is bound to create inadequacies costing welfare and economic loss. Without a strong effort to overcome this weakening of incentives, it is unlikely that exploration activity or gas production in Pakistan will recoup the trend observed up to 2005, i.e. 6 to 8 per cent increase in production per annum. , government irregularities in regulatory frameworks and policy formulation have also aggravated shortages. In the early 2000s, while facing acute gas shortages, the government put a rather poorly thought-out and counterproductive policy in place, prioritizing allocation to the commercial and residential sectors (paying below current average cost of supply) while putting fertilizer and power in second place. According to USAID estimates, however, the same gas would have provided great economic benefits had it been used for power generation. This realization came late for the government which later revised its gas allocation policy, only to ignore the merit order and supply gas to an inefficient, aging fleet of public plants resulting in gas wastages while more efficient plants continued to suspend production owing to acute shortages. The gas sector is laden with continuous implementation of poorly thought reforms and policies. A recent instance of the same is when OGRA decided to charge different tariff for RLNG and gas indicating both as separate products. Although, both RLNG and local gas are supplied mostly through the same network and metered through the same system but the latter is charged with lower UFG than the former despite the fact that RLNG is generally expensive and has lower actual loss. RLNG inducted into the system is mixed with indigenous gas coming from different sources is indistinguishable from other gas already in the system. Hence, there is no point in treating the same product as two and adding complexities in the already jumbled sector. Furthermore, the tariff for gas and electricity must be in sync and both sources must be treated as a commodity. Difference in pricing will eventually result in misallocation of resources and induce arbitrage opportunities. Variability in tariff creates disparity and hence must be kept in tandem by the regulator \u2013 and that too, should be same for both sources of energy. Furthermore, Pakistan\u2019s cost of power production is 26% higher for the industrial sector compared to other regional countries like Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Bangladesh, South Korea, Thailand and India, and it is 28% costlier for residential areas than the regional countries. To add to consumers\u2019 and investors\u2019 woes, inconsistent regulation between NEPRA and OGRA sends confused signals to consumers and investors, and creates disharmony in pricing strategies between gas and electricity. Additionally, since both are sources of energy, the variability in tariff on gas and electricity is $6.5/MMBTU (power generation at 40% costs approx. Rs. 10.5/Kwh) and \u20b59.0/kwh (Rs. 15/Kwh), creates opportunities for arbitrage in the system. Hence, the prices must be set in equilibrium at $6.5/MMBTU for gas and \u20b57.5/kwh for electricity as one of the measures in establishing an efficient system design.  , gas losses are a major drain in the system, causing acute shortages. It is estimated that Pakistan loses more than an eighth of gas during delivery and while many factors contribute to these high losses, the main ones can be traced to the ways in which SSGC and SNGPL are regulated, the institutions that manage most of the gas transmission and distribution in Pakistan.  No regulatory mechanism links their financial returns to their operational efficiency and tariff setting disproportionately rewards capital investment, encouraging firms to favour network expansion over pipeline maintenance. Both SSGCL and SNGPL have under-performed in managing distribution networks, leading to high levels of unaccounted for gas (UFG). UFG is typically 1\u20132 percent in OECD countries owing to better management and the larger share of bulk consumption in the consumer mix, whereas Pakistan\u2019s UFG (for July 2020) is 17.83% and 11.45% as estimated by SSGCL and SNGPL respectively. Moreover, underground leakage from aging pipelines and poor maintenance have contributed significantly to UFG in Pakistan. According to World Bank estimates, the average leakage rate is 4.9 leaks per KM for SSGC and 2.2 for SNGPL. By contrast, the same average is 0.22 in Germany and 0.36 in few states of the U.S. Needless to mention, another major area contributing to gas shortages is theft which accounted for 16.5% of total UFG in 2015, including 14% by unregistered users illegally drawing gas from pipelines and 3% by registered users tampering with meters. Moreover, SNGPL and SSGCL\u2019s \u2018saving technique\u2019 to conserve or reduce consumption by lowering pressure of natural gas during night hours is not only ineffective but also dangerous, extinguishing space heater and geysers resulting in fatal accidents. , and relatedly, the government\u2019s strategy to import LNG to address shortages is not a viable option and rather allows the problem to persist due to one simple reason:  . Lacking realization of this simple phenomenon, Pakistan\u2019s LNG imports continue to rise (see Table 2) e.g. they rose to 901 MMcfd during FY 2018-19 from 754 MMcfd in FY 2017-18, and their share in in overall natural gas supplies increased to 27% in FY 2018-19 from 24% the previous year.  , natural gas is used very inefficiently in Pakistan. This is partly because large quantities of appliances are produced by small-scale manufacturers that do not meet national or international standards of safety. Utilities that operate on commercial principles have to achieve acceptable standards of performance and management and/or their staff face actions when minimum performance standards are not met. Sadly, this is not the case in our country. Enforceability of standards on appliances for sale in the market can be ensured if regulation was brought about that any appliance that was to be connected to the system, must be approved for use by OGRA or any other body who may be assigned this task. So, with these perennial problems and chronic shortages plaguing the country\u2019s gas sector, what kind of future can we envision for ourselves? The Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL) predicts that Pakistan\u2019s indigenous oil reserves will be exhausted by 2025 and that the country will run out of domestic sources of natural gas by 2030. The sector-wise consumption of gas is provided in Figure 3 and Table 3. Given that more than half of existing gas reserves have already been exhausted while no noteworthy addition has been made to gas reserves in the last 17 years, and that the country now only has sufficient reserves to last just over 15 years in the best-case scenario where consumption is capped at present-day levels , the question is: what will become of all the consumers and businesses in this consumption mix? Does the government have any short- or long- term plans up its sleeve to save them from impending doom or all is bleak? Achieving the economic potential of energy efficiency is complex but Pakistan needs to start somewhere. According to ADB, being a developing economy means Pakistan still possesses high energy saving potential. It is currently 15% more energy intensive than India and 25% more intensive than Philippines in the Asian region, but reducing energy intensity can become a key priority to curb gas consumption and save it for peak hours to meet demand. An EY study concludes that Pakistan can benefit from measures with high potential energy saving such as (i) metering, (ii) thermal insulation of steam lines and valves (iii) tuning of boiler burners and improvement of the air-to-fuel ratio (iv) installation of heat recovery from exhaust flue gases (v) control of compressed air leakage, (vi) condensate recovery and (vii) heat recovery from wastewater, in energy intensive industries such as textile, sugar, paper and leather. The study also found that by adopting the aforesaid energy efficient practices, energy consumption in these industries in Pakistan could be reduced by a total of more than 3.7 million MWh annually. At the same time, increasing the energy efficiency of products can also provide a good starting point. Other South Asian countries like Bangladesh are already promoting efficient use of existing resources, both on the supply and demand side. Pakistan can learn much from their example and endeavour to maintain energy efficiency benchmarks at international standards to save gas and tackle shortages in short term. Under the existing circumstances, this seems to be the only way forward for Pakistan if it aims to resolve the perils and problems that have long plagued its gas sector.

The highest court of the country, the Supreme Court of Pakistan and High Courts throughout the country grant stay of recovery in eligible cases even where the vires of any law are challenged on the touchstone of the supreme law of the land-Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan (\"the Constitution). \nIn view of the hierarchical character of the judicial system in Pakistan, it is of paramount importance that the law declared by courts should be certain, clear and consistent. Inconsistencies create distrust in the administration of justice. It is an established fact that most decisions of the courts are of significance, not merely because they constitute adjudication on rights of parties and resolve disputes between them, but a fortiori in doing so they embody a declaration of law, operating as a binding principle (stare decisis) in future cases. In this latter aspect lies their particular value in developing the jurisprudence of law and the same is true in the matter of granting stay of recovery in tax matters. In a large number of cases where the vires of section 80C, 80CC and 80D of the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979 were challenged, recoveries were stayed, though the matter was finally decided against taxpayers by the Supreme Court in the Elahi Cotton Mills Ltd. and others v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Finance, Islamabad [(1997) 76 TAX 5 (S.C.Pak). \nOn the issue of interim stay, in the case of the Tharparkar Sugar Mills Ltd. v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Revenue Division and Chairman, CBR, Islamabad and another [1996] 73 TAX 215 (H.C.Kar.), the Sindh High Court held: \".....once a petition in tax matters is admitted that ispo facto shows that the petitioner has made a prima facie case....interim stay may be granted.\"This principle is held in a number of cases related to various taxes and its compilation is done in 'Principles of Income Tax Laws'(fifth edition, 2018) and in many other books. The point worth noting is that principles laid down for granting stay of recovery in tax matters, decided by Supreme Court and High Courts, have binding force under Article 189 and 201 of the Constitution. \nThe Lahore High Court in case of E.M.E. Cooperative v. CIT (2004) 90 TAX 359 (H.C.Lah.) held that application for stay of recovery should be given due consideration, which is a binding injunction/directions for all subordinate courts/tribunals/authorities. In another case reported as the Shoaib Bilal Corp. Faisalabad v. CIT, Faisalabad & another [(1993) 67 tax 233 (H.C.Lah.)], it was held: \n\"It is well-settled that stay order, unlike injunctions, operates from the moment, it is passed irrespective of the time of its communication....legally speaking, the communication of the stay order granted by this court is not relevant. Even if the Income Tax Officer was not aware of the stay order granted by this court, all the proceedings taken subsequent to it are nullity in the eye of law.\" \nThe Supreme Court of Pakistan and High Courts, in a number of cases held that recovery of demand without decision by an independent authority should not be made, meaning by that in eligible cases Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue and Customs Appellate Tribunal are under legal obligation to provide interim relief by way of stay before deciding the appeal if a prima facie case exists. The same principle will apply to provincial tax legislations. Some of the cases to this effect are: \n1. Mehram Ali and Others v. Federation of Pakistan and others PLD 1998 SC 1445 \n2. Sunrise Bottling Co. (Pvt.) Ltd v Federation of Pakistan and 4 others (2006) 94 TAX 140 (H.C. Lah.) \n3. Punjab Provincial Cooperative Bank Ltd, Lahore v DCIT 2002 PTD 2799 \n4. Dawood Textile Printing Industries (Pvt.) Ltd, Faisalabad v Federation of Pakistan and 4 others PTCL 2010 CL.460 \nIn the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 [hereinafter \"the Ordinance\"], the Commissioner Inland Revenue holding jurisdiction of the case may grant extension of time for payment of tax or allow the taxpayer to pay such tax in installments [section 128(1A)] though he seldom exercises these powers as meeting fixed targets/recovery is his/her main priority. Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) is also empowered to grant stay in income tax, sales tax and federal excise matters where appeals are filed. Collector (Appeals) is also empowered to grant stay under the Customs Act, 1969. In the Federal Excise Act, 2005 even the facility of automatic stay of six months is available in case 15 percent tax demand is paid along with appeal [proviso to section 37(3) of the Federal Excise Act, 2005]. \nFirst, appellate authorities, i.e., Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) or Collector (Appeals) are not considered as independent judicial forums as they are under administrative control of the Federal Board of Revenue(FBR) and can be transferred any time back to become part of field formation assigned the revenue collection targets. In the light of above case law, it is, therefore, imperative for the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue and Customs Appellate Tribunal to not only decide the appeals when filed before them but also adjudicate stay applications expeditiously on the basis of settled principles. \nThe rejection/refusal or stay with harsh conditions by first tax appellate authority also gives rise to application for stay before the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue and Customs Appellate Tribunal. In such cases, Tribunal may allow stay, waive harsh condition imposed by first appellate authority though appeals remain pending at first appeal level, or reject the same if no case is made out. \nWhere appeals and stay applications are filed simultaneously or stay applications afterwards when recovery is started, the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue and Customs Appellate Tribunal are under statutory duty to dispose of stay application before or with appeals expeditiously. The adjudication of application for stay independent of appeal is imperative, inter alia, for the following: \n* Legislature has provided statutory safeguard in section 131(5) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 [it equally applies to the Sales Tax Act 1990 by virtue of its section 46(2)] and section 194B of the Customs Act, 1969 so that the citizens/taxpayers are not put into undue jeopardy/difficulties till the final adjudication. \n* Tax departments should not use coercive measures for recovery before appeal is decided by an independent forum that is Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue and Customs Appellate Tribunal as it is the command of higher courts. In case the departments adopt such measures, the tribunals have to grant stay strictly in accordance with law/rules and principles settled by higher courts. \n* In cases where the impugned orders are prima facie unlawful, arbitrary, excessive, and/or unfair, Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue and Customs Appellate Tribunal are empowered, rather duty-bound, to grant relief after the aggrieved person makes out a case for unconditional and/or conditional stay after affording an opportunity to the department. \nThe above parameters are not exhaustive. They are only recommendatory in nature. The 'trinity' of prima facie case, financial stringency and balance of convenience is the basic tenet which is indispensable in consideration of a stay application independent of a pending appeal or even it is not filed, e.g., in cases where first appellate authority declines the stay or allows it with unreasonable conditions. \nSince tax tribunals are first independent judicial forums, it is necessary to discuss stay proceedings at this level in detail. In this respect, it is imperative to reproduce section 131(5) of the Ordinance to accentuate this point [almost the same position exists in Second Proviso to section 194B of the Customs Act, 1969]. It reads as under: \n(5) Notwithstanding that an appeal has been filed under this section, tax shall, unless recovery thereof has been stayed by the Appellate Tribunal, be payable in accordance with the assessment made in the case. \nProvided that if on filing of application in a particular case, the Appellate Tribunal is of the opinion that the recovery of tax levied under this Ordinance and upheld by the Commissioner (Appeals), shall cause undue hardship to the taxpayer, the Tribunal, after affording opportunity of being heard to the Commissioner, may stay the recovery of such tax for a period not exceeding one hundred and eighty days in aggregate: \nProvided further that where recovery of tax has been stayed under this section, such stay order shall cease to have effect on expiration of the said period of 180 days following the date on which the stay order was made and the Commissioner shall proceed to recover the said tax: \nProvided further that in computing the aforesaid period of one hundred and eighty days, the period, if any, for which the recovery of tax was stayed by a High Court, shall be excluded. \nIt is abundantly clear from plain language of section 131(5) of the Ordinance that appeal and stay application are two distinguishable acts. Notwithstanding that an appeal under section 131 of the Ordinance has been filed, Department can resort to recovery of disputed tax unless stay is granted by Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue. A conjunct reading of section 130, 131(5) and Proviso(s) added to it by the Finance Act, 2009 and subsequently substituted by the Finance Act, 2012 enunciate as under: \n1. On filing of application for stay in any case, where appeal is pending in Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue, order for granting stay or refusing it has to be passed independent of decision in appeal. \n2. Stay is to be granted after affording opportunity of being heard to the Commissioner Inland Revenue. \n3. Statutory period of stay is prescribed by Legislature and on expiry it stands vacated. \nIn a recent decision of the Division Bench of Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue in MA (Stay) No. 611/PB/2019 in ITA No. 413/PB/2019 (Tax year 2017) dated 15.11.2019 followed in MA (Stay) STA No. 1153/IB/2019 dated 19.11.2019, it is held asunder: \n\"...it is our humble view that the entrustment of the main appeal prior to fixation of the stay application to the Bench is necessary for the reason that if the Bench does not hear the main appeal then how it can hear and decide only the stay application which is ancillary to the proceedings. Interim relief is the part of main appeal and it is immutable principle of law which cannot be lightly brushed aside that where a Court is competent to allow final relief, it has also got the jurisdiction to allow interim relief. Reliance may be placed on the judgment report as Additional Collector-II Sales Tax, Lahore Vs M/s Abdullah Sugar Mills Ltd (2003 SCMR 1026). By following this principle it is essential to entrust the appeal and application simultaneously to the Bench and after that the said Bench shall hear and decide the matter. If this principle is not followed and the appeal is entrusted to one Bench and stay application to another Bench then the aforesaid principle of law would be violated which is not permissible in any cannon of interpretation. Further this kind of procedure may create difference of opinion amongst the Benches. For instance the Bench has granted the stay to the taxpayer and subsequently the application for extension in stay is filed by the same taxpayer on the same issue but fixed to another Bench, it may create difference of opinion between the Benches. Therefore, to avoid such anomaly it would be appropriate to fix all the applications to the concerned Bench having been already entrusted the main appeal by the competent authority.\" \nThe Full Bench of Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue has overruled the above judgement [in MA (Stay) STA No.1153/IB/2019 in STA No.328/IB/2019] and paragraph 10 of its order dated January 8, 2020 reads as follows: \nThe Sub-section (5) of Section 131 and its proviso are of paramount importance to resolve this controversy, which was inserted by Finance Act, 2003 dated June 17, 2003 while the proviso 3 was substituted by Finance Act, 2012. A bare reading of sub-section (5) reveals that preferring of appeal and filing of stay application are two independent and separate proceedings. Sub-section (5) of Section 131 starts with clause which means that sub-section precludes whether appeals has been filed by the taxpayer is recovery proceedings can be stayed by the Appellate Tribunal otherwise tax shall be payable in accordance with the assessment made in the case. First proviso to this sub-section also supports this point of view which clearly provides that on filing of application in a number of cases, the Appellate Tribunal is of the opinion that the recovery of tax levied under this Ordinance which has been upheld by the Commissioner (Appeals) causes undue hardship to the taxpayer. The Tribunal after affording proper opportunity of being heard to the parties may stay the recovery of such tax for a period not exceeding 180 days in aggregate. From this proviso it can safely be inferred that application for recovery of tax is to be heard separately and independently provided the conditions as laid in the first proviso of sub-section (5) of this Section are fulfilled. Firstly, application for stay of recovery is filed, secondly, Commissioner (Appeals) has refused to grant stay of recovery, thirdly, the appellate tribunal is of the opinion that the tax levied shall cause undue hardship to the taxpayer and fourthly opportunity of being heard shall be provided to both parties. Thus, if sub-section (5) of Section 131 of the Ordinance is read with all its three provisos, the conclusion is very obvious that the Appellate Tribunal may grant or refused to grant the stay of recovery of tax irrespective of the fact that the appeal has been filed by the taxpayer. \nThe arguments advanced by the Division Bench of Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue in MA (Stay) No.611/PB/2019 in ITA No.413/PB/2019 (Tax year 2017) dated 15.11.2019 [followed in MA (Stay) STA No.1153/IB/2019 dated 19.11.2019] now overruled and para 10 reproduced above of Full Bench of Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue elicited arguments amongst legal fraternity in favour and against the decisions. This issue, therefore, needs further elaboration for debate and discourse. \n(The writers, lawyers and partners in Huzaima, Ikram & Ijaz, are member Adjunct Faculty of Lahore University of Management Sciences) ", "name": "ogdc"}, {"count": 163, "date": "April 8, 2020", "url": "https://www.brecorder.com/news/587628", "article": "Fauji Foundation has appointed Waqar Ahmed Malik as their new Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director with immediate effect.

It has the largest portfolio of net hydrocarbon reserves in Pakistan, which includes 44 percent of oil and 37 percent of gas as of June 2020. The company contributed to 29 percent of Pakistan\u2019s total natural gas production, and 46 percent of its oil production in FY20.  Government of Pakistan is the largest shareholder in OGDC. Its disinvested part of its shareholding in the company back in 2003. Initially 2.5 percent of the equity with an additional green-shoe option offered to the public. Then in December 2006, the government divested a further 10 percent of its holding in the company. The breakup of the latest shareholding is given in the illustration.  Being the leading oil and gas E&P company, OGDC stay ahead with its & exploration and drilling activities despite the natural decline in the reserves, discoveries, and hence crude oil and gas production. A look at the OGDC\u2019s last three-year performance shows that while the company has been aggressive in its drilling activities as well as in acquiring seismic data, production of hydrocarbons has been on a downward trend. gas production particularly has been falling due to natural depletion in the mature fields.  However, when compared to FY13, the annual report for FY18 gives some indicators of improvement such as higher 2D and 3D seismic survey acquired; continued and sustainable drilling activity where the average number of exploratory/appraisal and development wells have remained constant; better crude oil, LPG and sulphur quantities sold over the years etc. But when looking at the financials, sales revenue and earnings show a decline not only due to weaker production stats but also lower oil prices that resulted in lower realised prices of oil and natural gas.  However, year-on-year performance of the E&P company was better due modest recovery in the price of crude oil. Plus, higher LPG production complemented by favourable exchange rate and planned capital spending contributed positively to the financial growth in FY18. Also, OGDC made 4 new oil and gas discoveries.  Here again, net earnings were affected due to increase in operating expenses, depreciation on account of capitalisation of assets and amortization of development and production assets on account of capitalisation of new wells and change in reserves estimates and higher cost of dry and abandoned wells owing to 11 wells declared dry and abandoned in FY18 against 4 wells in FY17 negatively affected the financial results.  FY19 was a profitable year for OGDC where net earnings increased by 50 percent year-on-year. This resulted from an increase in sales revenue by 57 percent year-on-year in FY19 due to increase in average net realised prices of crude oil and natural gas as well as flattish growth in the hydrocarbon production; crude oil production increase by 1.1 percent year-on-year, while natural gas production increased by 0.8 percent year-on-year. 16 wells were spud, comprising of 9 exploratory/appraisal and 7 development wells. OGDC\u2019s exploratory efforts yielded 3new oil and gas discoveries. FY20 was smeared by the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic. It was also a slow year for the oil and gas exploration and production sector where crashing oil prices along with COVID-19 had key impact on the sector\u2019s financial performance. OGDC saw its bottomline being impacted as FY20 earnings slipped by 15 percent year-on-year, where most of the decline came from 2HFY20. The squeeze in earnings started from the top as OGDC\u2019s revenues decreased by 6 percent year-on-year in FY20. The decline was both due to falling crude oil prices and production levels. Realized prices of crude oil witnessed a drop of around 20 percent to $46.76 per barrels whereas LPG realized prices also fell by 11 percent year-on-year to Rs63,997 per ton in FY20. Realized gas prices however, increased by 16.5 percent to Rs.393.32 per mcf. Production numbers were also subdued as COVID-19 left many fields like Nashpa, Mela and KAPDTAY in partial shutdown mode. Oil and gas production thus witnessed decline of around 12 percent each in FY20, while LPG production fell by 11 percent.  Despite decline in revenues, the company incurred higher in operating expenses, which affected gross profits. Furthermore, increase in all expenses including exploration, general administration, and finance cost and lower other income and no exchange gains affected the net margins. Growth in exploration expenses was due significant cost of dry and abandoned wells during the year as well as increased spudding.  It was hoped that the worst was over in terms of COIVD-19 once the lockdown restrictions were removed. There are two ways to look at OGDC\u2019s financial performance for 1QFY21: compared to 1QFY19, earnings and revenues slipped; but sequentially, the quarter portrays improvement. Overall, the company\u2019s earnings for 1QFY21 were seen slipping by 14 percent year-on-year, starting with a 10 percent year-on-year decline in the topline. OGDCL\u2019s revenues for the quarter were affected by decline in volumes for gas and oil versus those in similar period last year. During the period, the demand and price of crude oil remained suppressed as the coronavirus pandemic is far from over globally. Average realized prices of crude oil during the quarter were down by over 26 percent. The quarter recorded a 5.8 percent 3.6 and percent decline in average daily oil and gas production respectively, on a year-on-year basis.  Production of oil and gas was affected by natural decline in key field as well as annual turnaround and non-revival/partial revival of wells post COVID restrictions. Natural gas production was also down due to lower offtake from the power sector.  Higher operating expenses further dragged gross margins. However, lower exploration charges as well as higher other income offered some support to the falling earnings.  COVID-19 has made sequential analysis more meaningful as countries have gone and come out of lockdowns and related restrictions. Though the E&P\u2019s earnings declined year-on-year in 1QFY21, OGDC\u2019s financial performance for 1QFY21 versus 4QFY20 saw significant rebound in earnings as well as sales \u2013 (43%and 28% QoQ), which means that the coming quarters are likely to be better than at least the last quarter of FY20 that really bogged down the company\u2019s performance in FY20.

A sub-committee of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) meeting was held under convener Syed Naveed Qamar to examine the audit reports of the OGDCL for the year 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19. While examining an audit para relating to wasteful expenditure of Rs988 million on procurement of amine unit for Sinjhoro, the committee members learnt that a mine unit plant procured for Euro 6.272 million for Sinjhoro field for sweetening of natural gas was lying unutilised since 2014.  Purchase of plant was based on a study conducted by the consultant, M/s ENAR, who later conducted another study, wherein, significant financial benefits were forecasted on installation of a redundant equipment i.e Skid Membrane lying at Qadirabad site.  Thereafter, Skid Membrane was installed on site and installation of amine unit was dropped. The management stated that the study carried out by consultant, M/s ENAR, recommended utilisation of available Membrane of Qadirpur at Singhoro and amine unit for Soghari. The convener of the committee remarked that M/s ENAR was \u201cnotorious\u201d for over-procurement during his period as the petroleum minister as well and their assessments were \u201cfaulty\u201d in various cases.  The managing director OGDCL said that the company was trying to sell the plant to Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) or it would be utilised in other recoveries where oxygen levels would be above six to seven percent. In another audit para relating to loss due to ill-planned procurement of Rs65.8 million for Soghari Field, the convener committee said the audit reports were indicating that the company needed better planning with accurate assessment of data for future procurements. In yet another case, the audit official said funds were blocked due to unnecessary procurement of inventory items of Rs50 million.  The managing director OGDCL said that out of all items only two ball valves were unutilised, which would be used in future. Referring to an audit objection of demurrage charges of Rs27 million, an official of the OGDCL informed the committee that the company had procured equipments worth Rs25 billion annually.  While examining an audit para of irregular purchase of second hand fire lorry of Rs20 million, the convener remarked that the company always concluded inquiries only after the retirement or death of responsible people.  He further said under the Companies Act, the company had the authority to hold inquiry of their employees under services rules but it should be conducted in national interest and the findings should be shared with the ministry.

He maintained that the resignation of the MD is yet to be approved by the competent authority- the board of directors.  The secretary and the MD OGDCL appeared before a sub-committee of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), which examined the audit report of audit years, 2010-11 to 2017-18 of the Petroleum Division. Convener Committee Syed Naveed Qamar questioned the MD OGDCL, whether he had resigned or had not resigned. Responding to some media reports that the federal government and the OGDCL Board of Directors were not satisfied with his performance and due to the delay of decisions for two months in the OGDCL the company was losing its credibility, the MD said, \u201cI found lack of decision-making in the company [by the board] and all the tasks that were carried out, were with the directives of the MD\u201d.  He further said, \u201cDuring my tenure as MD, I tried hard to incorporate fairness and transparency in the affairs of the company but I failed\u201d. Earlier, the secretary interrupted and said the OGDCL was in the middle of restructuring and was hiring candidates to fill 10 to 12 high-level posts.  He said though the company had stable cash flow; however, it needed diversification to tap untapped deposits. Rejecting the explanation of the secretary petroleum, Naveed Qamar said what the MD OGDCL said was true. The committee also examined audit paras pertaining to the OGDCL. On Tuesday, the company announced its financial results for the year ended June 30, 2021.  Despite the adverse impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the oil and gas sector, the OGDCL, during the year, posted improved sales revenue of Rs239.104 billion (FY 2019-20: Rs232.925 billion). Higher sales are primarily attributable to increase in average realised prices of gas and LPG to Rs383.88/Mcf (FY 2019-20: Rs356.82/Mcf) and Rs66,345/ton (FY 2019-20: Rs63,997/ton), respectively. Moreover, enhancement in crude oil and LPG production coupled with rise in average exchange rate to Rs160.60/US$ (FY 2019-20: Rs158.32/US$) lent strength to financials.  However, lower average crude oil realised price of US$ 46.67/BBL (FY 2019-20: US$ 46.76/barrel) negatively influenced the financials. In addition to the above, the OGDCL\u2019s profitability during the year under review was impacted by reduction in other income on account of exchange loss and decline in interest income.  Moreover, higher operating expenses on account of increase in salaries, wages and benefits, work-over charges, repair and maintenance and amortization of development and production assets adversely affected the financial performance.  Nevertheless, the company recorded profit after tax of Rs91.534 billion (FY 2019-20: Rs100.938 billion) translating into an earning per share of Rs21.28 (FY 2019-20: Rs23.47).

This all was made possible due to the untiring efforts of OGDCL Management which is always committed to providing maximum facilities to its employees. In this context the management established a call centre for employees to take appointment before coming for vaccination and the response has been overwhelming. Not only the OGDCL employees and their families but the general public as well was inoculated at the facility on Saturday. Everyone appreciated the efforts of OGDCL management for this noble cause. The process is registered with NIMS and after inoculation of 2nd dose, employees shall be issued certificate from NADRA. This is the only such facility by any E&P Company in Pakistan. Like many other initiatives by the OGDCL management in combating the COVID-19 pandemic, establishment of this centre is a first in the E&P Sector in Pakistan. This is also a testament to the unflinching resolve of the OGDCL management towards facilitating their employees in the best possible manner.-PR ", "name": "ogdc"}, {"count": 174, "date": "September 7, 2021", "url": "https://www.brecorder.com/news/40118575/ogdc-discovers-gas-condensate-reserves-in-bannu-basin", "article": "OGDCL, being the operator of Wali Exploration Licence with 100% working interest, has made a gas and condensate discovery over Hangu Formation from its exploratory efforts at Wali # 01 well which is located in FR Lakki, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the notice to PSX added.

Of the four listed E&P giants, OGDCL led in revenue as well as earnings growth (3 and 9 percent, respectively). The sluggishness in revenues was primarily due to weak production volumes of natural gas with some recovery in crude oil production. Where OGDCL witnessed some recovery in its crude oil production which climbed by 2.3 percent year-on-year, it\u2019s natural gas production on average fell by 2.6 percent year-on-year in FY21. For PPL, crude oil production climbed by 3 percent year-on-year, and natural gas production declined by around 4 percent in FY21. POL\u2019s oil and gas production fell by one and three percent, year-on-year, respectively. However, Mari Petroleum saw a 17 and 8 percent rise in its oil and gas production during the year.   On the expenses side, the largest overhead: exploration and prospecting expenditure remained on the lower side, declining year-on-year in some cases and remaining flattish for others. Slower growth in exploration costs should technically support the bottomline, but it could also mean lower drilling activity. Exploration costs usually entail the cost of dry and abandoned wells - a decline of which year-on-year means that a lesser number of wells were declared dry compared to the previous period; but it could also show that fewer attempts were made or that overall recoverable reserves are declining.   Overall, the E&P sector\u2019s profitability was among key sector performance on the stock market. The sector performed well in the last quarter of FY21 due to a surge of over 150 percent in crude oil prices year-on-year as well as an increase in oil and gas production, which also supported the overall FY21 performance.

On March 18, 2021, CCoP reiterated that divestment of PPL shares shall be processed as already approved. On April 12, 2021, on another request, Petroleum Division reiterated earlier stance on ToRs. On May 21, 2021, on a summary submitted by Petroleum Division, CCoP decided that divestment of shares of PPL at current share price level is not feasible. Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL): As per CCoP decision, divestment of up to 7% OGDCL shares shall follow the divestment of PPL\u2019s shares. Petroleum Division, however, does not support divestment of GoP\u2019s shares in OGDCL at the current low price of the share. May 21, 2021, in response to a summary submitted by Petroleum Division, CCoP decided that divestment of shares of OGDCL at current share price level is not feasible. Nandipur Power Plant (NPP): In Feb 2020, an FA (UBL & EY) appointed whereas in September 2020, draft due diligence reports were submitted and shared with stakeholders for review. The following pending issues to be resolved by Ministry of Energy: (i) corporate carving out of NPP from NPGCL; (ii) separate power generation licence for NPP by Nepra; (iii) Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) and Implementation Agreement (IA); (iv) assets/liabilities to be transferred in name of new entity; (v) separate Gas Supply Agreement (GSA) for NPP and (vi) Income Tax and HR issues of NPP; and (vii) transfer of land by Wapda in the name of NPP/lease issue. On March 18, 2021, in response to PSO\u2019s claim over NPP in lieu of its recoveries, CCoP directed the Power Division to place a summary before CCoE for its decision. On April 21, 2021, Power Division requested to update on progress made in this respect. On May 06, 2021, all pending issues taken up with SAPM on Power and Petroleum, after which a committee is being constituted in Ministry of Energy for resolving all issues on fast-track basis. Guddu Power Plant (GPP): Hiring of an FA is being finalized. On March 18, 2021, CCoP directed Power Division to submit a summary to the CCoE, in light of the PSO\u2019s claim over GPP in lieu of receivables. The sources said that the following pending issues to be resolved by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division): (i) corporate carving out of GPP from CPGCL; (ii) charge created on GPP assets to be removed; (iii) separate power generation licence for GPP by Nepra; (iv) assets/liabilities of plant are to be transferred in the name of entity; (v) gas supply and Power Purchase Agreements to be signed; and (vi) transfer of Wapda land in the name of NPP/lease issue. For this purpose, a committee is being constituted in Ministry of Energy for resolving all issues on a fast-track basis. Sindh Engineering Ltd (SEL): The process for hiring of an FA has been reinitiated and on May 06, 2021, EoIs for FA published. Issues to be addressed are as follows: (i) constitution of SEL Board to ensure corporate structure and take decisions on matters related to privatisation; (ii) auditor to be appointed to get audited annual accounts up to date (from FY 2016-17 onwards); (iii) clarity on title of properties and possession; and (iv) mutation of property located at Mall Road Lahore (Chopra Building) and whether it will be sold as entity and real estate assets. Pakistan Engineering Company (PECO): The issues require resolution prior to initiation of privatisation process: (i) pending case of alleged illegal sale of shares by NIT, resulting in NAB investigations and a PAC review/directions since 2011; (ii) GoP payables of Rs7.2 billion (Rs2.3 billion of PC and Rs4.9 billion of Finance Division); (iii) the land held by PECO is not said to be fully mutated in entity\u2019s name; (iv) pending case in IHC filed by PECO; (v) \u201cdefault\u201d on repayment of a NBP loan by PECO and \u2018defaulter\u2019 status on Pakistan Stock Exchange; (vi) non-availability of approved audited financial statements; (vii) current management control, \u201cunauthorized JV\u201d in place at PECO between MD and a private firm; and (viii) inquiry initiated by SECP for non-compliances (March 26). On March 18, 2021 \u2013 CCoP directed MoI&P to resolve all pending issues of SEL & PECO, at the earliest. PAC also directed on March 11, 2021 not to privatise PECO till final disposal of audit paras. The government is expected to delist PECO from privatisation list as GoP liabilities outstanding against PECO stand at Rs7.2 billion. PC wants that GoP may settle its outstanding receivables by selling PECO\u2019s land and privatisation may be considered when the entity is free from inherent issues and all encumbrances. State Life Insurance Corporation (SLIC): The process of privatisation is contingent upon necessary legislation and pre-requisites of corporatization (pending with Ministry of Commerce). SLIC is proposed to be delisted from privatisation list till completion of corporatization process.

The Petroleum Division noted that it was incorporated in 1984 as a wholly-owned Public Limited Company with Fauji Foundation, Government of Pakistan and OGDCL as shareholders with 40%, 40%, and 20% shareholding respectively. The Company took over the assets, liabilities and operational control of Mari Gas Field and commenced business in its own name in 1985 under the Mari Gas Wellhead Price Agreement (Mari GPA). In 1994, the Government divested 50% of its share i.e., 20%, and the Company was listed on all the Stock Exchanges of Pakistan. The name of the Company was later changed from 'Mari Gas Company Limited' to Mari Petroleum Company Limited (MPCL) with effect from 12th December, 2012. The current shareholding patterns of MPCL are as follows; (i) Fauji Foundation - 40 per cent with management rights; (ii) OGDCL - 20 per cent; (iii)  GoP 18.39 per cent and; (iv) NIT/NBP/SLIC, General Public and Besos 21.61 per cent. The Petroleum Division further noted that since its inception, MPCL had been operating Mari field on a cost-plus fixed 22.5% Return on Equity (ROE) formula allowed under Mari Gas Pricing Agreement (GPA) executed in 1985 with the Government of Pakistan. The requirement of expenditure for exploration of oil and gas were met while remaining within the executed GPA. Subsequently, in pursuance of the ECC decision of May 4, 2001, Mari GPA was amended to allow the Company to incur expenditure on exploration activities not exceeding 30% of its gross revenues or an equivalent amount of $ 20 million which ever was lower. The guaranteed return to shareholders was also increased to 30% with escalation of 1% for every 20 MMCFD incremental gas production beyond the prevalent level of 425 MMCFD upto a maximum of 45%. Later, on May 15, 2012, the exploration expenditure limit of $ 20 million was increased to USS 40 million which was gradually to be achieved by $ 5 million every year in four years starting from year 2012. The Petroleum Division apprised that the ECC of the Cabinet while considering a summary submitted by erstwhile Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources (now Petroleum Division) on November 12, 2014 approved dismantling of Mari GPA executed in 1985 while replacing the prevalent wellhead gas pricing formula with a market-oriented formula effective July, 2014. The very reason for allowing replacement of wellhead gas pricing formula was to allow MPCL to undertake oil and gas exploration activities within and outside the Mari Field from its own generated resources including revenues from other fields as well as to bear all risks associated with such activities. In addition to this, ECC decided to continue the dividend distribution by MPCL having 45% cap on guaranteed return as per previously approved formula for the next ten years until 30th June 2024. Based on the ECC's decision the old GPA was replaced with a new GPA and was executed with the Government on July 29, 2015.  It was further apprised that MPCL had remained under consideration for privatization (divestment of GoP shares of 18.39%) since 2017 while a number of meetings were held on the issue in the Privatization Commission wherein it was decided to hire a financial advisor to undertake the transaction. Article 3 of Shareholding and Participation Agreement of June 3, 1985 executed between Government, M/s Fauji Foundation and OGDCL provides the first option of purchase of the shares by the remaining shareholders in case any party desires to sell or transfer shares in the Company subject to conditions set forth in the Agreement. Accordingly, pursuant to Government's intent to sell its shares, a Transfer Notice (intention to sell its shares) was issued to M/s Fauji Foundation and OGDCL who conveyed their \u2018no objection\u2019. Prior to serving the Transfer Notice, CCoP had approved the transfer price for selling 18.3% stake at a 5% discount to the closing stock price on the day prior to which the transfer notice had been served to the joint-venture partners. During the ongoing tenure of the present Government, the Cabinet Committee on Privatization in its decision of October 31, 2018 decided to put MPCL on the active privatization program with respect to divestment of GoP shares in the Company. However, before proceeding with the divestment decision, the issue of dividend distribution cap of 45% under the GPA remained under discussion. The matter was last discussed in a meeting of stakeholders on 29th November, 2019. After detailed deliberations, it was agreed that the existing dividend distribution cap of 45% under the GPA on MPCL shall be removed in order to ensure that the divestment transaction generates optimum sale proceeds for the Government. The Petroleum Division was tasked to initiate summary to seek approval of the ECC for removing the dividend cap and thereafter modalities regarding divestment of GoP shares would be followed in accordance with applicable laws/contracts. The dividend distribution cap was imposed for generation of adequate funds to meet the exploration expenditure of MPCL, whereas the Company has now conveyed that its present financial position allows continuity of its business as well as future committed investments in diversification projects upon removal of the dividend cap due to surplus cash reserves currently held by it. Petroleum Division submitted following proposals for consideration of the ECC on February 3, 2021: (i)  dividend distribution cap under executed GPA may be removed from July 1, 2020 subject to the condition that for the next four years i.e., until  June 30, 2024 the aggregate dividend distribution to shareholders shall not be less than the amount of dividend to be distributed under the capped scenario;(ii) company would ensure dividend distribution in accordance with the provisions of Companies Act, 2017 (amended through Companies Amendment Act, 2020) and the Companies (Distribution of Dividends) Regulations, 2017 and ;(iii) appropriate amendments in Clause 6.6 of the GPA would be made pursuant through a Supplemental Agreement to the GPA. During the ensuing discussion, the SAPM on Petroleum stated that there was cap of 45% on dividend distribution under the Gas Pricing Agreement which would be valid upto June 30, 2024. Under the capped scenario, the valuation of the company would remain depressed and on divestment of the Government share would not fetch better price. The Chairman ECC was of the view that 45% dividend cap was not a burden on the company as it was retaining balance 55% of dividend for reinvestment and had adequate cash for its activities. Adviser to the Prime Minister on Institutional Reforms & Austerity Dr Ishrat Hussain supported the views with remarks that removal of dividend cap may get potential buyers for the divestment of GoP shares. The Secretary Finance argued that removal of dividend cap may affect the balance-sheet of the company. Under the present arrangement guaranteed dividend of 45% was being distributed by the company. The GoP may lose the flow of distributable return reserve with the company under the uncapping scenario. However, the SAPM on Revenue Dr Waqar Masood Khan stated that in order to get better market value for the divestment, it was essential to remove the cap. The Minister for Privatization Muhammadmian Soomro also supported the stance of removal of cap while Minister for Power Omar Ayub endorsed it.

Tax expenditure in sales tax amounted highest at Rs. 578.46 billion (44% of the total), while in income tax amounted to Rs. 448.05 billion (34%), and in Customs, to Rs. 287.77 billion (22%). In last fiscal year 2019-20, FBR\u2019s tax collection was Rs. 3,997.4 billion. Hence, tax expenditure to total collection ratio comes to about 33%, and tax expenditure to GDP ratio stands at around 3.2%. The tax expenditure estimates are unadjusted amounts, meaning that elimination or repeal of a specific exemption would not necessarily produce the rupee amounts cited in this report. Actual receipts would depend on enforcement, taxpayer compliance, effective dates of legislation repealing the exemption, exact wording of any legislation, taxpayer\u2019s behavior, and some other economic factors. This report briefly outlines federal tax exemptions and concessions. These descriptions do not grant rights or impose obligations; rather, the tax laws and rules made thereunder determine actual tax liability. Each estimate is based on the best information available from public and private sources, including FBR\u2019s database. It would be exceptionally burdensome on taxpayers to require detailed reporting of transactions corresponding to each of the exemption sections and clauses. No such detailed reporting is imposed by statute or rules. Consequently, tax returns do not contain data sufficient to estimate the value of all exemptions and exclusions. Estimation requires identification of pertinent, useful data available from various external sources. Where exemptions identified in tables have not been estimated, it is because requisite data does not exist or have not been identified and acquired from an external source. Tax Exemption under 5th Schedule (Zero rated Items) Under Section 4 of the Act, goods exported, or the goods specified in the Fifth Schedule; supply of stores and provisions for consumption aboard a conveyance proceeding to a destination outside Pakistan as specified in section 24 of the Customs Act, 1969 (IV of 1969); such other goods, as the Federal Government may specify by notification in the official Gazette, whenever circumstances exist to take immediate action for the purposes of national security, natural disaster, national food security in emergency situations and implementation of bilateral and multilateral agreements are charged to tax at the rate of zero per cent. Under section 13 of the Sales Tax Act 1990, supply of goods or import of goods specified in the Sixth Schedule are, subject to such conditions as may be specified by the Federal Government, are exempt from tax under the Act. The Federal Government is empowered to issue exemptions whenever circumstances exist to take immediate action for the purposes of national security, natural disaster, national food security in emergency situations and implementation of bilateral and multilateral agreements, by notification in the official Gazette. Exemptions can be on any supplies made or imports, of any goods or class of goods from the whole or any part of the tax chargeable under the Act, subject to the conditions and limitations specified therein. Under section 3 (2) (b), Federal Government is empowered to declare that in respect of any taxable goods, the tax shall be charged, collected and paid in such manner and at such higher or lower rate or rates as may be specified, subject to such conditions and restrictions as it may impose, by notification in the official Gazette. B. Nature of exemptions and concessions In sales tax act, concessions are granted broadly by three ways: i.e. Zero Rating, In some cases, product based concession is granted under sales tax act, for example, in case of food and grocery items, certain products are exempt or have reduced rate of sales tax. It may get tricky because these exemptions can then have rules within rules. Prepared foods and ready-to-eat food items may be exempted or have reduced rate whereas the same items if sold under brand name may not have the concession. Under the Act certain products that are intended to be used for in-house consumption, for use of a specific organization are given tax concession. Typically, this is where, the end consumers are not liable to be taxed, or intended to be given tax concession. Diplomats, diplomatic missions, diplomatic organizations, non-profit organizations or government agencies often are not required to pay sales tax. This concession in the form of zero rating or exemption is extended to these national and international agencies. C. Suggestion for further improvement of Sales Tax estimates The reporting and calculation of tax expenditures estimates may be improved through: In previous estimates it was suggested that in sales tax act, concessions are granted broadly by three ways, i.e. zero rating, exemptions, and reduced rates. The sales tax return of any registered person may not be considered as true and valid return, without mentioning exempt supply, if any. This will help in computing the exemption incidence when exempt supplies are made by various registered persons in supply chain. Industry-ratios and/or standardized minimum value addition formulas may be issued, with the consultation of major industries, to have more accurate and rational estimates, and so that exact extent of value addition in each industry can be estimated. Engagement of Experts and Internees Various expert, working in the universities may be engaged to develop a broad based consultancy and opportunities may be provided to young university graduates to apply various statistical tools on the data for improvement in reporting and calculating tax buoyancy The team engaged in SPR&S may be trained in National and International well reputed institutes for understanding and opting international best practices. a) Statutory rates of Customs Duty (CD), Regulatory Duty (RD), and Additional Customs Duty (ACD) have been taken as benchmark rates. Customs related exemptions / concessions are generally sector based. b) While making calculations, any deviation from statutory rates has been considered as c) Period of study is FY 2010, i.e. July 2019 to June 2020. d) Report is based on figures in respect of customs duty exemptions given under chapter-99 (Rs.12,635 million). FTA/PTAs (Rs.34,210 million), 5th Schedule to Customs Act, 1969 (Rs.137,418 million) and exemptions given under other SROs (Rs.55,877 million) including export oriented exemption/concession SROs. Methodology for Customs Duty Cost Estimation Data for estimations of Customs is also taken from FBR\u2019s official database, and estimations were Calculated against statutory rates of duties, using revenue forgone approach. Definition of the VAT Gap: The VAT Gap refers to the VAT Policy Gap or the VAT The VAT Policy Gap: The VAT Policy Gap is the difference between the Potential VAT collectible under a benchmark or standard regime\u2019 of the VAT (where there are no exemptions, lower rates or special treatment of any type of consumption or sector/class of taxpayers), and the Potential VAT collectible under the current regime (which includes any special treatment of consumption or sector/class of taxpayers). The VAT Policy Gap estimates the revenue foregone due to the current policy of the government. The VAT Compliance Gap: The VAT Compliance Gap is the difference between this Potential VAT collectible under the current regime and the Actual VAT collection. The VAT Compliance Gap estimates the gap in VAT due to non-compliance by taxpayers. This study estimates VAT Policy GAP for the year 2021. Efficient collection of taxes is considered as a cornerstone of a good tax system. However, because of non-compliance and other VAT foregone this efficiency may not be achieved. Therefore, it creates a Gap between potential VAT and actually collected VAT. Given tax base, if taxes remain unpaid, would cause burden on those who are contributing in this regards. Which is unfair and creates distortions in the economy. Further these unpaid VAT would put burden on the overall public finances resulting in either curtailing the government expenditures or increase the debt burden. Both of which are detrimental for growth and development goals of the government. Despite healthy revenue growth especially by FBR (for the period 2001-2020 average growth is 13.9%), Pakistan\u2019s overall revenue collection has been low when compared to the expenditure outlays. One of the core reason for these under or low payment in relation to the base is because of Tax Expenditures1. These are normally reported2 and Governments throughout the world use tax expenditures as an alternative policy option to achieve social objectives and promote economic growth. Tax expenditures as a percentage of the total tax collected (income, sales, FED, and customs) have been increasing over time. In Tax Expenditure Report 2020, based on data pertaining to Financial Year 2018-19, it has increased to an estimated Rs. 1,150 billion in which Tax expenditure for Sales Tax amounted the highest at Rs. 518.8 billion (45% of the total), and in Customs Rs. 253.1 billion (22%). In FY 2018-19, FBR\u2019s tax collection was Rs. 3,828 billion. Overall, tax expenditure to GDP ratio stands at around 3%. Understanding the scale and the scope of VAT policy gap and evaluating cost and benefit analysis is prerequisite for fiscal governance especially for high deficit countries like Pakistan. One of the suitable approaches to measure the VAT Gap is Top-down approach. In the present analysis only \u201cVAT-GAP\u201d model estimation is done using Supply Use Tables. Sales Tax is currently single largest tax revenue source for FBR. In FY 2019-20 it amounted to 1,597 Billion Rs. which is approximately 40% of the total tax collected by FBR. For Sales Tax (Domestic) the base is considered to be Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) and for Sales Tax (Imports) the base is imports. The assessment of VAT gap analysis provides a tool to tax administrators, policy makers and relevant stakeholders, which can be roped through policy choices. We use a detailed input-output model of Pakistan\u2019s economy to estimate the potential VAT form domestic sales. This supply-use table provide information on the final consumption as well as the production and use of goods and services in the economy. Not only does the model provide information on total use or gross sales for each of the 40 sectors in the supply-use table but it also provides crucial information on the intermediate and value of primary use, the value of import and exports, and the value of investment expenditures. In other words, the Input-output model provides the necessary information to the model \u2018Pakistan\u2019s potential sales tax base\u2019, including the taxable supplies, input credits, and refunds on exports. The most recent Input-output model for Pakistan\u2019s economy is for 20173. We re-benchmark this model to reflect the level of Pakistan\u2019s economy by sectors values for 2020, using national accounts data. The accuracy of our VAT gap estimates suffer significantly because the I-O model does not fully capture the informal sector. The supply-use table provides information on the final consumption of consumer, government, exporters. The final consumption of commodities includes the VAT in the value. We eliminate the VAT from consumption at commodity level first, then we apply the Commodity VAT rate to calculate the potential VAT Policy Gap using the Supply-Use table.   The VAT Policy Gap is the difference between the Potential VAT collectible under a  benchmark of the VAT (where there are no exemptions, lower rates or special treatment  of any type of consumption or sector/class of taxpayers), and the Potential VAT collectible  under the current regime (which includes any special treatment of consumption or  Potential policy VAT GAP= (Final Consumption - VAT) \u00d7   - ((      -           )\u00d7       \u2022 The estimates suggest VAT policy gap is about $ 3.5 billion which is approximately To understand the methodology used to estimate the VAT gap, it is necessary to review Some GDP accounting identities. There are three approaches to estimate the GDP, the Income approach, expenditure approach, and the production approach or value added approach. As Input-output table uses both the expenditures approach (horizontally along the row of the model) and the model value added approach (vertically along the columns of the model) to GDP accounting. Where C is the final consumption expenditures. I is the gross investment expenditures, G is the government purchases of goods and services, X is the value of exports and M is the value of imports The subscripts c stands for the commodities (sectors) We can obtain an expression for the sales tax base by solving the left-hnad-side of (1) for final consumption (C), which yields the following expression  Substituting (2) into the right-hand-side (1), we obtain an equivalent expression for the Sales tax base=  ( { Value Adeed i + M i - I i - X i) - G  Multiplying (3) by the sales tax rate ( ) and re-arranging the resulting expression, we Potential VATC ({ tc X (Total Use c + M i - I i  - X c - G c )) Potential VAT   Policy Gap =({(Total Use c + M i - I i  - X c - G c )) x t The equation (5) provides operational definitions that are useful for estimating VAT Policy GAP. \u2022 Using the value added approach, the estimates suggest gap is about $ 3.8 billion which is approximately 23 percent of VAT under current regime. This gap close to the VAT policy gap measured by the consumption approach. Major part of government tax revenues is collected by FBR. A substantial increase in the tax collections has been witnessed during last two decades. FBR tax collection was just around Rs.392 billion in 2000-01 which has jumped to around Rs.4 trillion in 2019-20. The average growth till FY 2017-18 remained 14.1%, however, due to Covid-19 pandemic the yearly growth has plummeted, thus affecting slightly the average annual growth for the period 2001-2020 as well (13.9%). 1.1 Five Years FBR Collection Trend The last five years\u2019 collection trend is shown in the following table. The 5 years average growth was 9.3%, however, by excluding the last two years, average growth for normal years i.e. FY 2013-14 to FY 2017-18 stands at 14.6% (Table 1).

This performance is very encouraging as compared to previous couple of years. The nine months target has been achieved to the exte FBR collects Direct Taxes (DT), Sales Tax (Domestic & Imports), Federal Excise Duty (FED) and Customs Duties (CD). In this study tax-wise buoyancy estimates have been used to forecast the FBR head-wise revenues for FY 2021-22. The tax buoyancy is an indicator to measure efficiency and responsiveness of revenue mobilization in response to growth in the GDP or national income. A buoyant tax means the tax revenues increase more than proportionately in response to a rise in national income/GDP/base. The SPRS Wing before budget, projects the head-wise revenue estimates based on buoyancy estimates6 from previous years on rolling basis. Tax-wise buoyancy estimates are calculated by using historical collection and respective bases data. The current tax-wise buoyancy estimates are estimated from data for the years 1999-2000 to 2019-20 in respect of economic indicators i.e. GDP, Non-agri GDP, LSM and Imports. The respective proxy bases of head-wise FBR taxes are as under: Direct Taxes (DT)                        Non-agri GDP Sales Tax Domestic (STD)                 Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) Sales Tax Imports (STM)                  Import Value Customs Duties (CD)                      Dutiable Import Value Federal Excise Duty (FED)                LSM Buoyancy estimates are derived as =            % Change in Actual Revenues  Since these tax bases have a dynamic relationship with GDP, in the second step      % Change in Respective Base  we have calculated the buoyancies of           % Change in GDP Finally these two are multiplied to arrive at respective tax to GDP buoyancies= % Change in Actual Revenues                    % Change in Respective Base % Change in Respective Base                    % Change in GDP Using these buoyancy estimates autonomous growth for each tax is estimated by using the projections provided by Finance Division for each proxy base.7 It provides for the GDP Growth and inflation forecast for upcoming year. GDP value used for this projection of growth is Gross Value Addition of Sectors at Constant Factor Costs. Using the inflation forecasts these GDP growth estimates are converted into GDP growth estimates at Current Factor Cost. Further, GDP-Gross value addition at Current Factor Cost is used for measuring the Buoyancy estimates to be used for revenue forecasts. In respect of Direct Taxes (DT) Non-Agri GDP has been taken as its proxy base. The buoyancy of direct taxes has been estimated in two steps: in the first step Direct Tax to Non-Agri GDP and in second step Non-Agri-GDP to GDP (Gross Value Addition-Current Factor Cost) is estimated. Then two buoyancy estimates have been multiplied to estimate the Direct Taxes to GDP Buoyancy estimates. Direct taxes to Non-Agri GDP Buoyancy (B1)    =     % Change in Direct Taxes Non-Agri GDP to GDP Buoyancy (B2)             =     % Change in Non-Agri GDP Direct taxes to GDP Buoyancy                  = B1 * B2 Similarly for Customs (CD) the proxy base is dutiable imports, whereas the projections as provided by Finance Division are for the total imports. Therefore, the buoyancy has been estimated in two steps: first Customs to dutiable imports and in second step Dutiable Imports to total Imports and then these two have been multiplied to get the CD buoyancy estimates. For Federal Excise (FED) and Sales Tax (Domestic) the base is Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) and for Sales Tax (Imports) the base is imports. Therefore, for these taxes the buoyancy values are directly estimated from proxy bases. Following table reflects the respective buoyancies which are estimated using simple log-log regression method in excel sheet by using log values of actual data for taxes. In the second step autonomous growth has been estimated by multiplying buoyancy estimates (Table 3) to projected growths of respective bases (Table 4): Table 4:                                            Growth Assumptions for FY 2021-22 Table 5 provides an autonomous growth parameters for each tax head. These are based on the buoyancy estimates from the last 20 years actual revenue collection data and the macroeconomic proxy bases provided by Pakistan Bureau of Statistics/Annual Economic Surveys and the growth projections published in Budget Strategy Paper / Economic Adviser\u2019s Wing, Finance Division. These autonomous growths will be used to project the autonomous growth estimates of respective revenue heads. To be sure of the results robustness a small exercise was also done by using the reduced and increased nominal growths by 10%. The resulting change was insignificant. 2.2 Head-wise Revenue Projections FY 2021-22 The autonomous growth (Table 5) has been applied on base year\u2019s expected collection (i.e. 2020-21) for each respective head to project an increase of Rs. 636 billion. This addition has been added in the expected collection of FY 2020-21 thus, the revenue forecast for FY 2021-22 without additional Policy/Admn measures has been obtained to the tune of Rs. 5,336 billion. The required growth over the expected collection of FY 2020-21 i.e. Rs. 4,700 billion would be 13.5% in FY 2021-22. However, with the addition of Policy/Admn measures the target for FY 2021-22 would be Rs. 5,829 billion, which is near to IMF suggestion i.e. requiring a growth of about 24.0%. (*) This excludes Policy/Admn Measures and consists of projection due to autonomous growth It has been found that the overall FBR taxes are buoyant (1.04 overall buoyancy) and there is a potential for increase in tax revenues provided that macroeconomic indicators are doing well. It is evident from last 20 years data that FBR revenues increased substantially with around 14% average growth. The head-wise break-up reveals that the direct taxes are most buoyant with I.13 buoyancy value, followed by sales tax (domestic) with 1.11 buoyancy estimates. On the other hand, sales tax (imports), customs and FED have relatively lesser buoyancies. In this regard, addressing the issues of narrow base, unnecessary exemptions and valuation problems at import stage can be instrumental for making these tax heads more buoyant, thus enabling the revenue organization to fetch more tax revenues. The revenue forecast for FY 2021-22 by applying the buoyancy estimates and projected respective macroeconomic indicators would be Rs.5,336 billion without Policy/Admn measures. After adding Policy/Admn measures the target would be Rs.5,829 billion. However the revenue collection and achieving of target would largely depend on the performance of the economy against the targets.

Sheikh entered the Pakistani political arena during the dictatorship of Pervez Musharraf. From 2000 to 2002, he was Sindh\u2019s Finance Minister. In 2003 he won a PML-Q Senate seat, referred to as the \u2018king\u2019s party\u2019, and was promptly appointed as Minister for Privatization which he left in 2006 amidst considerable accolades as the country witnessed the largest-ever privatisation in its history during this period. It was speculated at the time that his departure was due to serious differences with the then prime minister Shaukat Aziz who privately expressed his reservations at Sheikh\u2019s ambition to replace him as the country\u2019s finance minister \u2013 the only portfolio that General Musharraf reportedly allowed Aziz to lord over. The Privatisation Commission (created on 22 January 1991) provided the following figures on its website of transactions carried out between April 2003 when Sheikh was appointed and December 2006: (i) Banks \u2013 51 percent of Habib Bank shares sold for 22,409 million rupees to Agha Khan Fund for Economic Development in December 2003; (ii) 9 capital market transactions through stock exchange to the general public including third offer of NBP (604 million rupees) in November 2003, OGDCL 5 percent share sale netting 6851 million rupees in November 2003 with two more transactions in December 2006 (the first netting 44,893 million rupees with the GDR offering to international institutions and 0.5 percent share sale of OGDCL with GDR offering to domestic institutions netting 2070 million rupees); 10 percent of SSGC shares in February 2004 for 1734 million rupees, 5.8 percent PIA shares for 1215 million rupees, PPL 15 percent shares in July 2004 netting 5633 million rupees, UBL 4.2 percent shares netting the government 1087 million share, and KAPCO 20 percent shares for 4815 million rupees, on April 2005; (iii) energy sector 51 percent shares in NRL sold to Attock Refinery and 73 percent shares to Hassan Associates in May and November 2005 netting a total of 32,275 million rupees; (iv) telecommunications - 26 percent shares of PTCL to Etisalat in July 05 at 155,992 million rupees and carrier telephone industries to Siemens Pakistan Engineering on October 2005 for 500 million rupees; (v) three cement plants \u2013 Dandot and Kohat Cement (10 percent additional shares from what was sold in 1992) to EMG, Mustekham Cement netted 3205 million rupees sold to Bestway cement and Javedan cement company limited sold to Haji Ghani Usman group in August 2006 at 4316 million rupees; (vi) chemicals - Khurram chemicals additional 10 percent sold to Pfizer Pakistan for 6 million in October 2003 and Ittehad chemicals 10 percent additional shares sold to EMG for 26 million rupees October 2004; (vii) Pak Arab fertilizer 94.8 percent shares sold to Export Reliance consortium for 14,126 million rupees on May 2005 and Pak American fertilizers sold for 280 million rupees to Azgard 9 in July 2006; (viii) Ghee - Kohinoor mills sold for 81 million rupees to Iqbal Khan in May 2004 and United Industries Limited sold to Akbar Magoo for 8 million rupees in September 2005; (ix) industrial units - Bolan Textiles sold to Sadaf Enterprises for 128 million rupees October 2005 and Lasbella Textile Mills sold to Raees Ahmed for 156 million rupees in November 2006; and (x) international advertising sold to EMG in April 2005 for 5 million rupees and Falettis hotel sold for 1211 million rupees to 4 B Marketing. Five observations are in order which may compel one to conclude that the privatization policy during Hafeez Sheikh\u2019s tenure as Privatization Minister was perhaps not an unqualified success. First, Shaukat Aziz, not a qualified economist, took full credit for the privatization policy during Musharraf\u2019s entire tenure however one would be hard pressed to agree with his claims. Second, balance sheets of the privatized companies at the time are no longer available to determine whether they were running into losses or profits at the time (though the consensus is that most if not all were profitable) and if so whether the Privatization Commission bothered to undertake a cost benefit analysis with the cost inclusive of foregone government profits for the next five years. Third, if one takes the Etisalat transaction out of the equation (155,992 million rupees) then total privatization proceeds during Hafeez Sheikh\u2019s tenure as the country\u2019s Privatization Minister amounted to 100,674 million rupees i.e. if December 2006 transactions when he had already resigned are not taken into account. Fourth, the names of some strategic investors/buyers crop up more than once with allegations against Sheikh that he favoured some over others where strategic investors were preferred and that he continued his support during his more recent stint as finance minister though without any investigation the allegations, like those hurled against some members of the opposition remain unsubstantiated. And finally, there has been no evaluation as to the success or otherwise of the privatised companies though Etisalat has yet to clear 800 million dollars and the sale of K-Electric is widely regarded as a failure due to its appallingly poor delivery and the continuation of government subsidies. In March 2010, after Shaukat Tarin\u2019s resignation the Zardari-led Pakistan People\u2019s Party, with a dearth of economists within its ranks, chose Hafeez Sheikh as the finance minister in 2010, a position he held till 2013. His tenure began with a failure to honour the pledges made by his predecessor to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on tax and power sector reforms leading to the suspension of the Fund programme with two tranches remaining. Sheikh\u2019s resignation was prompted reportedly by President Zardari\u2019s offer to nominate him as the country\u2019s caretaker prime minister which was unmet; after he left the country he laid the blame for placing the country on the path to yet another IMF programme by end 2012 on President Zardari. Imran Khan\u2019s selection of Hafeez Sheikh and a dismissal of his own long time loyalist Asad Umar from the finance portfolio was seen by his critics as indicative of establishment support, though in all probability Khan was stumped on who to appoint after he had reportedly reached the conclusion (which he admitted more than a year later) that his biggest mistake was in not going on a Fund programme soon after he took oath as the country\u2019s prime minister \u2013 a volte face from what he and Asad Umar had maintained before taking oath. During Sheikh\u2019s two stints as the country\u2019s de facto finance minister - March 2010 to February 2013 and 20 April 2019 to 29 March 2021 - he took the country back to the policies from before especially with respect to the eighteenth constitutional amendment and the National Finance Commission award which led the Fund to state in its press release dated 12 May 2019 that \u201cto improve fiscal management the authorities will engage provincial governments on exploring options to rebalance current arrangements in the context of the forthcoming National Financial Commission\u201d. What was more disturbing was Sheikh\u2019s denial during his media interactions and to parliament that he had reached an agreement with the Fund on the matter. If Shaukat Tarin becomes the de facto finance minister it bears reminding that as the architect of the last NFC award he is unlikely to make the same mistake as he has remained focused on a steady rise in revenue as per the NFC award \u2013 one percent rise as a percentage of GDP every year to meet the centre\u2019s financial needs. Sheikh\u2019s economics if not entirely shaped by international donor agencies (domestic debt rose from 16.5 trillion in August 2018 to 23.7 trillion rupees in September 2020) were certainly influenced by them and together with monetary policy decisions taken by the State Bank of Pakistan are responsible for the containment of the growth rate to 1.5 percent last year (pre-Covid-19). In addition, his failure to understand that the influence peddlers in the country would resist the Fund sponsored tax and power sector reforms making it impossible to achieve his unrealistic revenue targets within one year, is inexplicable as he faced somewhat a similar situation in 2010. Timing and phasing of the Fund programme was simply not appropriate, as stated by Shaukat Train in a recent interview. Tarin has always maintained that he resigned in 2010 because of personal reasons yet many of his close associates maintain that he resigned because the Zardari government refused to implement the necessary tax and power sector reforms. Imran Khan should be reminded that Shaukat Tarin took on the entire PPP cabinet during his previous tenure by insisting on third party audit of rental power projects \u2013 a decision that stood the country in good stead. To conclude, one would hope that the country\u2019s power centres \u2013 political and non-political \u2013 understand that degrees from a good university abroad and/or experience in international donor agencies do not guarantee an individual\u2019s ability to think out of the box or a capacity to compel his cabinet colleagues to deliver on reforms. One can only hope that this is a final farewell to Hafeez Sheikh.

PPP President Sindh Nisar Ahmed Khuhro said this during a press conference in village Karan Khan Shoro at the residence of the Provincial Minister for Irrigation Jam Khan Shoro. He was accompanied by PPP Senator Taj Haider and Senator Sussi Paleejo. Criticising the federal government Nisar Khuhro said that the federal government moulded the actual indexes and told a fake success story of three years of its tenure but the ground realities are different. He said that 70 percent of the country's production is based on agriculture and but at present due to incompetence of federal government the agriculture sector has been shaken due to the lack of water supply in Sindh. The province had not be given a constitutional share of water as per the 91 Accord, according to the 91 Accord the agriculture has been given priority in the water usage but due to injustice of the federal government, the Chashma Jhelum Link Canal and TP Link Canal have been opened in Punjab due to which Sindh is facing shortage of water down stream and the Guddu as well, but IRSA is silent on the issue. He said that according to the constitution, there should be a representative from Sindh in IRSA but sadly there is no representation of Sindh there.  He further said that we do not want to fight with any province but we demand that IRSA must give our legitimate share of water. He said that another injustice done by the federal government was to repeal the Act passed by the National Assembly and more than 16,000 employees of Sindh from federal departments like OGDCL, IB, FIA, KPT have been unemployed which is a great injustice and lawlessness. He further informed that federal government also did injustice in population census and its details are also available, when the matter had been raised by the provincial government in the Council of Common Interest, they did not considered our reservations. He demanded that the chairman of the IRSA should be removed and the representative of Sindh should be appointed soon. Replying a Question Nisar Khuhro said there was no any misunderstanding between Makhdoom House and the PPP and there is no truth in these rumours, Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari would visit Makhdoom House very soon. He commented that Makhdoom family is the asset of PPP. In a reply to a question PPP senator Taj Hyder said that in Senate standing committee on water we also raised the water issue but the Chairman IRSA denied to answer. He said in 91 Accord all the terms were decided so it's better to act as per the Accord, as it was decided that agricultural use of water is the top priority so why CJ and TP canal are being opened. Answering a question of media Irrigation Minister Sindh Jam Khan Shoro said that in 2018 we raised the issue of Three-Tear formula in Council of Common Interest and the report compiled by Anwar Mansoor it is clearly written that Three-Tear formula has no legal cover. MNA Shugufta Jumani, Waqar Mahdi, Aajiz Dhamrah, Shagheer Qureshi, Aftab Khanzada, Pasha Qazi, Ali Nawaz Shah Rizvi and other leader of PPP were present on the occasion.

For the sake of ease in reading section references and details have been avoided.  Syed Shabbar Zaidi, the founder was the Chairman of Federal Board of Revenue on July 1, 2019 when Pakistan came under the International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF\u2019s) programme. There were detailed discussions on the suggestions and strategies for improving tax collection in Pakistan. Almost all the suggestions and strategies were found to be in the interest of the country. The compliance is encouraging.  One of the subjects that always cropped up during those discussions was the issue of \u2018cost of tax exemptions\u2019. This for a layman means that tax that is not being collected on account of certain exemptions from tax provided under the tax laws of Pakistan. The IMF rightly considers that such exemptions are to be gradually withdrawn. The actions undertaken through this bill are an attempt for the same. In the following paragraphs after discussing the main exemptions withdrawn certain matters where a conceptual error and harmful disruption have been made in the system have been identified. It is considered that such matters will be taken into account in the final legislation on the subject. The IMF\u2019s general view may be correct however ultimate decision on these matters is to be taken on the basis of what is feasible and useful for the country. Based on experience, IMF will agree to the same if appropriately apprised.  There cannot be exact estimation of the monetary effects of these changes; however, in our view there will be no major additional revenue. It is very unfortunate that if revenue is a consideration for withdrawal of exemptions, for example, with respect to inter-corporate group dividend or then such an action should not be carried through in the Act. This is an act against documentation and promotion of large organized businesses which is essential for Pakistan. Furthermore, conditions provided for intangible exports of filing the returns and other compliance are to be introduced for tangible exports where there is completely non documentation for tax purposes. Removal of this distortion will improve exports as there will be proper record keeping. Furthermore there should be immediate action for donations and subscription for unregistered organization which pose a financial security risk for Pakistan, especially under the FATF.               It has been observed that in certain cases the concept of vested rights has been disturbed. Pakistani\u2019s record in this respect is very reasonable. It is therefore suggested that any adventure in this territory be avoided.  Except for certain places where economic rationale has been disturbed the overall document is reasonable. There is a need to evaluate the monetary consideration and unless there is substantial benefit in the period between June 30, 2021 and the date when this bill will become an act, this legislation should not be passed. It should form part of the Finance Act 2021. In any case almost all the amendment are effective accordingly.      This chapter deals with the major amendments introduced in the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001. These in effect do not represent withdrawal of exemptions. There are certain effects of withdrawal of exemptions in relation to these amendments however these effectively constitute clarifications, readjustments and introduction of compliance procedures.  The concept of donation has been clarified. Now voluntary contribution and subscription will also be eligible for benefit for the payer. In addition to eligible persons following shall be added for eligible recipient:  i. person eligible for tax credit under section 100C of this Ordinance;  ii. entities, organizations and funds mentioned in the Thirteenth Schedule to this Ordinance. List is the same as in the past laid down in Clause 61 of the Second Schedule to the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 which is now called Thirteenth Schedule. Chapter 4 of these notes.   In effect these payments were earlier covered one way or the other. The subject has been simplified. There are many positive changes with respect to the levy of penalty under the Ordinance.     In line with international practice and to promote documentation and compliance an appropriate concept of zero rate tax has been introduced. Under this concept instead of exemption a tax credit equal to 100% tax has been introduced for the following sectors:  (a) persons engaged in coal mining projects in Sindh supplying coal exclusively to power generation projects;  (b) a startup as defined in clause (62A) of section 2 for the tax year in which the startup is certified by the Pakistan Software Export Board and the following two tax years;  (c) persons deriving income from exports of computer software or IT services or IT enabled services up to the period ending on the 30th day of June, 2025: Provided that eighty per cent of the export proceeds is brought into Pakistan in foreign exchange remitted from outside Pakistan through normal banking channels. Explanation.- For the purpose of this clause, \u2013 (i) \u201cIT services\u201d include software development, software maintenance, system integration, web design, web development, web hosting and network design; and (ii) \u201cIT enabled services\u201d include inbound or outbound call centres, medical transcription, remote monitoring, graphics design, accounting services, HR services, telemedicine centers, data entry operations, locally-produced television programmes and insurance claims processing.  Tax credit under sub-section (1) shall be available subject to fulfilment of the following conditions, namely:-  (b) tax required to be deducted or collected has been deducted or collected and paid;  (c) withholding tax statements for the immediately preceding tax year have been filed; and  (d) sales tax returns for the tax periods corresponding to relevant tax year have been filed: Provided that nothing contained in this section shall preclude the applicability of section 214C or section 177.  It is strongly suggested that this zero rated concept be introduced for all persons subject to presumptive taxes, including exports. At the moment, the process leads to complete non-documentation.  Reintroduction of Capital Investment Tax Credit for certain industries The concept of a tax credit equal to 25% of the value of investment has been introduced for capital investment in the undermentioned sectors:  (a) Greenfield industrial undertaking as defined in clause (27A) of section 2 engaged in \u2013  (i) the manufacture of goods or materials or the subjection of goods or materials to any process which substantially changes their original condition; or  (b) Industrial undertaking set up by the 30th day of June 2023 and engaged in the manufacture of plant, machinery, equipment and items with dedicated use (no multiple uses) for generation of renewable energy from sources such as solar and wind, for a period of five years beginning from the date such industrial undertaking is set up.  Eligible investments are investments made in purchase and installation of new machinery, buildings, equipment, hardware and software except self-created software and used capital goods.  Zero rating for income of charitable and welfare institutions On an overall basis it transpires that there is no substantial change in the exemption available to charitable institutions and NPOs. The general zero-rating for non-profit organisation as defined in Section 2(36) of the Ordinance has been limited to certain specified kinds of institution as listed below. However, as explained below this change has effectively no consequence.   In this connection, it is highly desired that other non-registered institutions receiving donations should also be taxed or included in the persons required to be tax compliance. This is essentially the objective of FATF.       Section 100C that provided exemption to welfare institutions has been completely rewritten. In our view, there is no material change and various clauses at various places have been placed under the revised section.     Only the following persons shall be subjected to zero rate tax. (a) persons specified in Table - II of clause (66) of Part I of the Second Schedule to this Ordinance;  (b) a trust administered under a scheme approved by the federal government and established in Pakistan exclusively for the purposes of carrying out such activities as are for the welfare of ex-employees and serving personnel of the federal government or a provincial government or armed forces, including civilian employees of armed forces and their dependents where the said trust is administered by a committee nominated by the federal government or a provincial government;  (d) a welfare institution registered with provincial or Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) social welfare department;  (e) a not for profit company registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan under section 42 of the Companies Act, 2017;   (f) a welfare society registered under the provincial or Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) laws related to registration of co-operative societies;  (g) a waqf registered under Musalman Waqf Validating Act, 1913 (VI of 1913) or any other law for the time being in force or in the instrument relating to the trust or the institution;  (h) a university or education institutions being run by non-profit organisation existing solely for educational purposes and not for the purposes of profit; (i) a religious or charitable institution for the benefit of public registered under any law for the time being in force; and  (j) international non-governmental organisations (INGOs) approved by the federal government.  Apparently there is a fundamental change by way of deletion of zero rating for NPO\u2019s however in substance there is no change as all NPO\u2019s are either trusts or societies registered under the societies\u2019 regulations.  The following income of such institutions remain eligible for zero rating: (a) income from donations, voluntary contributions and subscriptions;  (c) income from investments in the securities of the federal government;  (d) profit on debt from scheduled banks and microfinance banks;  (e) grant received from federal, provincial, local or foreign government;  (f) so much of the income chargeable under the head \u201cincome from business\u201d as is expended in Pakistan for the purposes of carrying out welfare activities: Provided that in the case of income under the head \u201cincome from business\u201d, only so much of such income shall be eligible for tax credit under this section that bears the same proportion as the said amount of business income bears to the aggregate of income from all sources; and  (g) All income of the persons mentioned in clauses (a), (b) and (h) as above.

Many exemptions have been withdrawn. In the following paragraphs only the relevant and substantial amendments have been discussed. Furthermore, the cases of exemptions withdrawn where a policy error has been made have been identified. Prime Minister, Cabinet and the Parliament would have to look into these matters.    Inter-corporate dividend for group companies This is the most misunderstood subject in corporate taxation in Pakistan. After a detailed deliberation involving State Bank of Pakistan, Securities & Exchange Commission of Pakistan and Federal Board of Revenue a comprehensive framework has been developed for group taxation. This framework is in line with international best practices and economic realities. One of the main feature of group taxation or group tax relief is that there is no inter-corporate dividend within group companies. This has been laid down in this clause. This clause was earlier spoilt by the amendment frequently made on the basis of inadvertent and incomplete understanding of law by the FBR and the then policymakers. The original clause was corrected in 2019. It is now proposed to be withdrawn. Withdrawal of this clause means that policymakers have no idea about group companies\u2019 structure and corporate finance. It appears that due to an inadvertent understanding IMF personnel have also been misguided on this matter. It is urged to the organised corporate sector to explain the policymakers that some vested interests are intentionally creating disruption in the development of big business group in organised sector. This clause if withdrawn will be detrimental to documented economy. Consistency is being spoiled for the sake of complacency. It is to be appreciated that this is not an exemption. It is a prerequisite for formation of groups in the industrial sector. The action undertaken is completely non-comprehensible.  A proposal to delete this exemption is also a reflection of lack of understanding of the primary economics of the country and the prevalent laws. Those who have suggested should know the reason for insertion of this clause. In Pakistan agriculture income cannot be taxed. This exemption stated that income from company engaged in agriculture will also be exempted. This is based on economic rationale as well as the decisions of the superior courts. It has been held that when the primary source is not chargeable to tax the secondary source by way of dividend can also not be taxed. Notwithstanding the legal aspect, it will be suicidal for agriculture sector which is facing severe institutional problem if in this country it is decided that agriculture income by non-corporate sector will be exempt from federal income tax whereas corporate sector will be taxable. This fallacious action is required to be immediately withdrawn.  Capital gains on disposal of export processing zone entities This exemption has also been withdrawn without understanding the concept for which this clause was inserted. Entities in EPZ are outside the ambit of taxation in Pakistan. They are taxed by way of a sum paid before export to EPZ Authority. These entities are not registered under the corporate laws of Pakistan. This exemption is effectively a clarification. There is no sense in undertaking this act as it will be an exercise in futility.    Royalties and technical fees earned by Pakistan This exemption has also been wrongfully withdrawn. This shows complete lack of understanding the existing provision. This is the best exemption laid down in the law. It exempts Pakistani persons and enterprises the income earned abroad for providing patent and technical fees. For example, if companies like Packages Ltd provides such services abroad then they are not taxed on that income. This withdrawal is totally unjustified and reflects lack of clarity on the matter.   Income of power generation projects Agreements for power generation projects and exemption for their income is detrimental to economy of Pakistan. These agreements are per se US $ denominated bonds issued to these enterprises. There is a need to amend all such agreements. Government is doing a remarkable step in revising these agreements with consent. There should have complete withdrawal of exemptions laid down under Clause 132 of the Ordinance; however, being a sovereign commitment, Government of Pakistan on the basis of its consistent policies should not withdraw exemptions under the existing agreements which are an obligation unjustified but legally enforceable. It is a completely justified action that no exemption will be available for agreement undertaken after July 1, 2021.   Income of approved loan agreements   There is practically no change however instead of \u2018income\u2019 words profit on debt and capital gains have been used. Capital gains on loan should not be exempted.  This clause is applicable to private sector also, however, there is effectively no loan except of government owned entities which have been exempted under this clause. It is considered that private sector loan exemption be withdrawn. It is completely discretionary.  The other exemption under Clause 90 for such loans has rightly been withdrawn. It was discretionary.  Income from sale of immovable property to a REIT is exempt from tax. This clause is not related to income of REIT that remains exempt. This clause was inserted to promote REIT.  There is no case for withdrawal of such exemption as such income is anyway not chargeable to tax after a certain holding period. This exemption is conceptually wrong. There cannot be any distortion in tax incidence only for the reason that business has been designed in compliance to certain divine revelations. It has been correctly withdrawn. Furthermore, this system became effectively useless after compulsory distribution of 90 percent of profit with a dividend rate of 25%. A correct step    This exemption practically remained in effective on account of complicated procedures at SECP. There is a case for inclusion of this exemption along with income of Collective Investment Scheme as both are essentially same products.  The income of mutual funds is exempt from tax if 90% of their income, as reduced by capital gains is distributed. This exemption is laid down under Clause 99 of Part 1 of the Second Schedule to the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001. Furthermore, by way of exemption under Clause 103 capital gain of such mutual funds is also exempt if such funds are money market funds. It is proposed to delete the exemption under Clause 103. Henceforth all funds have been equated as far as exemption is concerned.  There was no reason for this exemption. However now there is no case for withdrawal of exemption once given. This will erode confidence of non-resident investors who were entitled to that exemption. The answer is the redemption of Bonds if possible.      Special purpose company under securitization process This exemption has wrongly been withdrawn. It is not an exemption. It is a mode of recognizing a pass through entity. This withdrawal is to be withdrawn.  There was no case for exemption for this activity; however, once exempted there should not be any withdrawal of exemption unless the existing contract expires. This is simple concept of vesting rights. These actions destroy Pakistan\u2019s investment climate.  This exemption was not justified at the first place however the same cannot be withdrawn before the expiry of the date prescribed at present which in June 30, 2023.   Pipeline project of oil and gas extracting companies  Withdrawal of the right for similar tax as is for oil and gas extraction business for pipeline operation should not be withdrawn. There is no economic rationale. This will create nothing except complication. No additional revenue.  Contracts executed outside Pakistan  Income from contracts executed outside Pakistan is exports and should have been zero-rated. However in Pakistan on tangible exports are considered as exports. There is a 50% reduction in the rates for income from foreign contract. It is proposed that such concession be withdrawn. This is completely non-comprehensible. This should be immediately changed.  Same is the case of foreign income of Pakistan Cricket Board.  Revaluation and devaluation in case of entities under the Fifth Schedule This exemption has rightly been withdrawn. However it has to be ensured that provisions of the Fifth Schedule are subject to Mining Act, 1948. If such a right is laid down in that act then the same would have to be retained.  Below ground installations in petroleum business are allowed 100% depreciation throughout the world. Same is the case in Pakistan. This exemption is proposed to be withdrawn which represents improper understanding of business. Similarly deletion of Rule 4 of the Fifth Schedule is not to be withdrawn as it is practice internationally and this is only a timing difference.  Definition of industrial undertaking The discretionary powers of the federal government to declare an entity as industrial undertaking have rightly been omitted. The concept of First Year Allowance in addition to initial depreciation has rightly been omitted.           THE THIRTEENTH SCHEDULE (See section 61)   29 Khair-un-Nisa Hospital Foundation, Lahore.  Provided that the federal government shall have the power to add, amend or omit any entry in this Schedule.\u201d ", "name": "ogdc"}, {"count": 189, "date": "June 24, 2022", "url": "https://www.brecorder.com/news/40182179/oil-and-gas-development-company-limited", "article": "The Government of Pakistan is the largest shareholder in OGDCL with over 67 percent, followed by OGDCL Employee Empowerment Trust and Privatisation Commission of Pakistan. A breakup of shareholding pattern is given in the illustration. OGDCL is one of a leading E&P companies because of its aggressive exploration and drilling activities over the course of its history. The steady rise in its production flows amid depleting country reserves show the strength of the company. This has also been accompanied by a steady rate of discoveries. The company recently discovered new oil and gas reserves in Sindh and Punjab. In FY18, OGDCL\u2019s oil volumes continued to rise, while the company faced a decline in gas volumes sold due to lower production. Profitability of the company continued to improve primarily due to modest recovery price of crude oil. Plus, higher LPG production complemented by favourable exchange rate and planned capital spending contributed positively to the financial growth in FY18. However, the company faced increase in operating expenses, depreciation and higher cost of dry and abandoned wells owing to 11 wells declared dry and abandoned in FY18 against 4 wells in FY17 that impacted earnings. In FY19, rise in revenues again came from higher average realised crude oil prices and higher average realised gas prices. OGDCL\u2019s revenues were seen climbing by 27 percent year-on-year and bottom-line expanded by 57 percent year-on-year. Crude oil and gas production remained flat, while LPG production increased during the year. Also, rise in average exchange rate, and increase in other income and share of profit in associate accompanied with decline in exploration and prospecting expenditures strengthened the profit after tax. However, profitability in FY19 continued to be affected increase in operating expenses mainly on account of amortization expense. OGDCL\u2019s bottom-line slipped by 15 percent year-on-year in FY20 due to crashing oil prices along with Covid. The squeeze in earnings started from the top as revenues decreased by 6 percent year-on-year. The decline was both due to falling crude oil prices and production levels. Realized prices of crude oil witnessed a drop of around 20 percent whereas LPG realized prices also fell by 11 percent in FY20. Production numbers were also subdued as Covid-19 left many fields in partial shutdown mode. The company also incurred an increase in operating expenses, which aided the decline in gross profits. Absence of exchange gains restricted other income growth and increase in all expenses including exploration, general administration, and finance cost also impacted the bottom-line. Growth in exploration expenses was due to significant cost of dry and abandoned wells during the year. The E&P sector witnessed recovery in FY21. The trend of falling average gas production continued in FY21. However, some recovery was witnessed by OGDCL in its crude oil production. Along with the increase in crude oil and LPG production volumes, average realised prices for natural gas up by 8 percent year-on-year were the driving factors for revenue growth for OGDCL in FY21. However, decline in gas production as well as flat crude oil realised prices offset the gains, and OGDCL\u2019s topline grew marginally by 2.65 percent in FY21. Earnings for the E&P Company grew by 9.3 percent year-on-year, which was supported by a five percent year-on-year decline in the exploration and prospecting expenditure during the year. However, the profitability during the year was affected by reduction in other income due to exchange loss and decline in interest income, and higher operating expenses primarily due to higher amortization, development and repair cost. OGDCL\u2019s profits were gushing in 9MFY22 as high oil prices along with currency depreciation have been key factors of growth in the revenues of oil and gas exploration and production sector in FY22 so far. OGDCL\u2019s revenues increased by 36 percent year-on-year in both 3QFY22 and 9MFY22 because of spiking international oil prices amid rising demand as well as geopolitics, and depreciation of local currency significantly contributed to the growth. The average realized price of crude oil was up by 63 percent in 9MFY22 year-on-year. However, the production side has been slipping primarily due to natural decline in fields; crude oil average daily production was down by four percent year-on-year, while natural gas average daily production was down by two percent year-on-year. Nonetheless, decline in oil and gas production was partially mitigated by injection of eight operated wells by the E&P Company. Apart from the rise in topline, the growth in OGDCL\u2019s bottom-line was also due to increase in other income coming from hefty exchange gains from currency depreciation. Finance and interest income grew by 3.5 times in 9MFY22. On the expenditure side, there was a drop of 10 percent year-on-year in exploration and prospecting expenditure in 9MFY22. Oil prices have continued to drive earnings for the E&P sector and the prices are not coming down. Currency depreciation has been a companion in driving the E&P sector\u2019s earnings.

With over 67 percent, the Government of Pakistan is the largest shareholder in OGDCL, followed by the OGDCL Employee Empowerment Trust and Privatization Commission of Pakistan. A breakup of the shareholding pattern is given in the illustration.  On the operational side, OGDC has been leading the E&P sector because of its size and aggressive exploration and drilling activities over its history. Moreover, its steady rise in production flows amid depleting country reserves show the company\u2019s strength. As a result, the company has seen a growth in the total volumes sold of oil, gas, and LPG over the years, along with a steady rate of hydrocarbon discoveries. In FY18, OGDCL\u2019s oil volumes continued to rise, while the company faced a decline in gas volumes sold \u2013 which can be taken as a decline in production. On the other hand, profitability continued to improve primarily due to the modest recovery price of crude oil. Plus, higher LPG production complemented by a favorable exchange rate and planned capital spending contributed positively to the financial growth in FY18. Also, OGDC made four new oil and gas discoveries during the year. However, an increase in operating expenses, depreciation and higher cost of dry and abandoned wells owing to 11 wells declared dry and abandoned in FY18 against four wells in FY17 were inhibiting factors for earnings.   In FY19, OGDCL\u2019s revenues increased by 27 percent year-on-years, and botomline expanded by 57 percent year-on-year. The rise in revenues came from the higher average realized crude oil prices and higher average realized gas prices. On the production side, crude oil and gas production remained flat, while LPG production increased. The company spud 16 wells in FY19, and it made three new oil and gas discoveries. Also, a rise in the average exchange rate and increase in other income and share of profit from associates accompanied the decline in exploration and prospecting expenditures, strengthening the bottomline. However, profitability in FY19 was partially impacted by the increase in operating expenses, mainly due to amortization expenses.  FY20 was a slow year in general and for the E&P sector, where crashing oil prices and COVID-19 had a critical impact on the sector\u2019s financial performance. OGC\u2019s bottomline slipped by 15 percent year-on-year, where most of the decline came from 2HFY20. The squeeze in earnings started from the top as revenues decreased by 6 percent year-on-year. The decline was both due to falling crude oil prices and production levels. Realized crude oil prices witnessed a drop of around 20 percent, whereas LPG realized prices also fell by 11 percent in FY20. In addition, production numbers were down as COVID-19 left many fields in partial shutdown mode. Oil and gas production thus witnessed a decline of around 12 percent each in FY20, while LPG production fell by approximately 11 percent.  The company incurred an increase in operating expenses, which aided the decline in gross profits. The absence of exchange gains restricted other income growth and increased expenses, including exploration, general administration, and finance costs, also impacted the bottomline. Growth in exploration expenses was due significant cost of dry and abandoned wells during the year, as eight wells were declared dry and abandoned in FY20 versus only 2 in FY19.  FY21 was a year of recovery for the E&P sector. The trend of falling average gas production continued in FY21, and for OGDCL, it was lower by 2.6 percent year-on-year. However, OGDCL\u2019s crude oil production recovered by 2.3 percent year-on-year. Along with the increase in crude oil and LPG production volumes, average realized prices for natural gas, up by 8 percent year-on-year were the driving factors for revenue growth for OGDCL in FY21. However, a decline in gas production and flat crude oil realized prices offset the gains, and OGDCL\u2019s topline grew marginally by 2.65 percent in FY21.  Earnings for the E&P Company grew by 9.3 percent year-on-year, which was supported by a 5 percent year-on-year decline in the exploration and prospecting expenditure as fewer dry wells were incurred in FY21 versus FY20. However, the profitability during the year was affected by the reduction in other income due to exchange loss and decline in interest income, and higher operating expenses primarily due to higher amortization, development, and repair cost.  FY22 has benefited Pakistan\u2019s oil and gas exploration and production sector because of spiking international oil prices amid rising demand and geopolitics and depreciation of local currency significantly. Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (PSX: OGDCL) in 1HFY22 has seen its profits increase due to the same factors. Starting with the topline growth, OGDCL\u2019s revenues for 2QFY22 grew by 46 percent year-on-year, while the bottomline growth stood at 87 percent year-on-year. Overall, 1HFY22 revenues climbed by 36 percent, while earnings increased by 63 percent year-on-years.  Topline growth was driven by a 77 percent year-on-year rise in international crude oil prices, three percent currency depreciation, and a slight uptick in crude oil production for OGDCL during 1HFY22. The average net realized price of crude oil increased by 63 percent year-on-year in 1HFY22, while that of natural gas sold was up by around 7 percent year-on-year. Crude oil production was up by one percent year-on-year; however, the natural gas production was down by 3 percent year-on-year in 1HFY22. OGDCL\u2019s bottomline grew due to an increase in other income that came from hefty exchange gains from currency depreciation. On the expenditure side, two times increase in exploration expenditure in 2QFY22 offset the decline of 23 percent year-on-year in 1QFY22- taking the 1HFY22 expense up by 32 percent. OGDCL spud six wells, including four exploratory wells and two developments well.  Oil prices have continued to drive earnings for the E&P sector.

A breakup of shareholding pattern in given in the illustration. On the operational side, OGDC has been leading the pack of E&P companies not only because of its size, but also its aggressive exploration and drilling activities over the course of its history. Its steady rise in production flows amid depleting country reserves show the strength of the company. Over the years, the company has seen a growth in the total volumes sold of oil gas and LPG along with steady rate of hydrocarbon discoveries. In FY18, OGDCL\u2019s oil volumes continued to rise, while the company faced a decline in gas volumes sold \u2013 which can be taken as a decline in production. Profitability on the other hand continued to improve primarily due modest recovery price of crude oil. Plus, higher LPG production complemented by favourable exchange rate and planned capital spending contributed positively to the financial growth in FY18. Also OGDC made 4 new oil and gas discoveries during the year. However, increase in operating expenses, depreciation and higher cost of dry and abandoned wells owing to 11 wells declared dry and abandoned in FY18 against 4 wells in FY17 were inhibiting factors for earnings. In FY19, OGDCL\u2019s revenues were seen climbing by 27 percent year-on-year, and botomline expanded by 57 percent year-on-year. The rise in revenues came from higher average realised crude oil prices as well as higher average realised gas prices. On the production side, crude oil production and gas production remained flat, while LPG production increased during the year. The company spud 16 wells in FY19 and it made three new oil and gas discoveries. Also, rise in average exchange rate, and increase in other income and share of profit in associate accompanied with decline in exploration and prospecting expenditures strengthened the bottomline. However, profitability in FY19 was partially impacted by increase in operating expenses mainly on account of amortization expense. FY20 was a slow year in general and for the E&P sector too where crashing oil prices along with COVID-19 had key impact on the sector\u2019s financial performance. OGC\u2019s bottomline slipped by 15 percent year-on-year, where most of the decline came from 2HFY20. The squeeze in earnings started from the top as revenues decreased by 6 percent year-on-year. The decline was both due to falling crude oil prices and production levels. Realized prices of crude oil witnessed a drop of around 20 percent whereas LPG realized prices also fell by 11 percent in FY20. Production numbers were also subdued as COVID-19 left many fields in partial shutdown mode. Oil and gas production thus witnessed decline of around 12 percent each in FY20, while LPG production fell by around 11 percent. The company incurred an increase in operating expenses, which aided the decline in gross profits. Absence of exchange gains restricted other income growth and increase in all expenses including exploration, general administration, and finance cost also impacted the bottomline. Growth in exploration expenses was due significant cost of dry and abandoned wells during the year as 8 wells were declared dry and abandoned in FY20 versus only 2 in FY19. FY21 was a year of recovery and this was also witnessed across the E&P sector. The trend of falling average gas production continued in FY21 and for OGDCL it was lower by 2.6 percent year-on-year. However, some recovery was witnessed by OGDCL in its crude oil production which increased by 2.3 percent year-on-years. Along with the increase in crude oil and LPG production volumes, average realised prices for natural gas up by 8 percent year-on-year were the driving factors for revenue growth for OGDCL in FY21. However, decline in gas production as well as flat crude oil realised prices offset the gains, and OGDCL\u2019s topline grew marginally by 2.65 percent in FY21. Earnings for the E&P Company grew by 9.3 percent year-on-year, which was supported by a 5 percent year-on-year decline in the exploration and prospecting expenditure as less number of dry wells was incurred in FY21 versus FY20. However, the profitability during the year was affected by reduction in other income due to exchange loss and decline in interest income, and higher operating expenses primarily due to higher amortization, development and repair cost. The earnings for the E&P giant continued to be a multiple of 2Ps: price and production. During the 1QFY22, OGDCL\u2019s revenues grew by 27 percent year-on-year, while the bottomline growth stood at 44 percent year-on-year. Topline growth was driven by a whopping 60 percent year-on-year rise in average realized crude oil prices along with a 5 percent rise in average realized natural gas price. Production of crude oil was up by over 3 percent year-on-year too. However, gas production was down by around 7 percent year on year. Along with the increase in crude oil and LPG production volumes, average realized prices for natural gas was also higher by 8 percent year-on-year. Growth in OGDCL\u2019s bottomline was also lent by lower operating and exploration expenses. Prospection and exploration expenditure was down by 23 percent year-on-year as one well was declared abandoned and dry in 1QFY22 versus three in 1QFY21.\n ", "name": "ogdc"}, {"count": 199, "date": "August 17, 2022", "url": "https://www.brecorder.com/news/40192041/ogdcl-to-provide-rs28248m-assistance-to-taleem-foundation", "article": "OGDCL believes that proving ourselves as responsible, efficient and conscientious operators, we become the partners of choice in the area of company\u2019s operations and concessions.

The issues of Pak-Iran Gas Pipeline, joint projects between OGDCL, National Oil Refinery (NIOC) and pending issues between NTDC, CPPA-G and Iranian company Tavanir will also come under discussion, in addition to promotion of barter trade and payment mechanism. Sharing details on Pak-Iran Gas Pipeline, the sources said that both sides have emphasized their commitment towards early solution of IP project under GSPA and agreed to take necessary measures. In this regard, Petroleum Division has communicated that the government of Pakistan is committed to implement the project. During the visit of Prime Minister of Pakistan to Iran in April 2019, it was agreed that the legal teams from both sides would engage in finding out plausible legal solutions for the implementation of the project. Accordingly, both sides executed an Amendment Agreement No. 3 to the Iran Pakistan Gas Sales and Purchase Agreement (IP-GSPA) with NIOC on 5th September, 2019 in Istanbul, Turkey. Consequent to the signing of the Amendment Agreement No. 3, both sides have extended period of limitation for any claims under or in connection with the IP-GSPA as it is permitted under the applicable French law, allowing more time to the Parties to engage and further discuss the way forward on the IP project. On joint projects between OGDCL and National Iranian Oil Company NIOC, the sources said, during 20th session of JEC, Pakistani side expressed OGDCL & PPL interest in evaluating the E&P opportunities in Iran. According to sources, OGDCL has expressed the desire to work as joint venture partner with NIOC for exploration of hydrocarbons within Iran and worldwide. ODGCL would also like to join hands with National Iranian Oil Company in evaluation of the potential of unexpected areas, shale gas, tight gas reserves, and enhanced oil recovery projects in Pakistan. However, due to US sanctions, no cooperation could have been materialized so far. WAPDA and TAVANIR entered into a contract agreement for 30 years for 32-MW electricity on November 6, 2002 to meet the requirement of Makran Division in Balochistan. The rates per kwh were revised from time to time. The last revision was made on March 15, 2019. TAVANIR has also shown an interest to supply power to other bordering areas. Quetta Electric Supply Company is working on this and a response will be conveyed to Iranian side shortly. The sources maintained that MoU was signed in April 08, 2007 for import of 1000-KW power from Zahedan, Iran to Quetta, Pakistan. Feasibility report concluded jointly was submitted to NTDC in 2010. The estimated cost will be $700 million. NTDC approved the MoU in 2012; however, the approval of ECC is awaited. After approval of ECC the PPA will be negotiated with Tavanir. As decided in 2014 during the 19h session of Pak-Iran JEC, necessary arrangements have been made to make outstanding payments to Tavanir\u2019s designated companies within Pakistan. This was further reinforced during the meeting held in 2019 between Tavanir, Power Division, Central Power Purchasing Agency, Pakistan (CPPA-G) and National Transmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC). As modus operandi, CCPA-G discharges itself of payment obligations by receiving Payment Order Letters (POL) from TAVANIR nominated beneficiary for receipt of payments in Pakistani rupees and makes payments as per its liquidity situation. Such payments are later on confirmed by Tavanir. According to sources, CPPA-G has noted that as on September 17, 2020, payment of about $100 million to Tavanir  on account of import of electricity is pending due to non- availability of banking channels. However, payment against authority letter i.e. POL-31 is in process. NTDC had earlier requested M/o Commerce to develop some formal mechanism for making outstanding payment owed by CPPA-G to Tavanir.

Thus, in the new framework agreement, Barrick Gold of Canada will continue to own 50 percent stake in the project while the remaining 25 percent will be owned by government of Balochistan.  The total cost of the project is estimated to be around $10 billion which is likely to be completed over a period of 5-6 years, once the process of legislation is approved, according to CEO of Barrick Gold. Though the details of the settlement agreement have yet to be revealed, there are reports that the out of court settlement is contingent upon the penalty of $900 million which will be disbursed to previous company Antofagasta, Farhan Mahmood at Sherman Securities said. In the notifications by OGDC and PPL, it seems that the penalty would be paid by the federal government via these three SOEs, he added. \u201cWe believe that this amount will be paid upfront while the remaining contribution will be invested over a period of 5-6 years,\u201d Farhan Mahmood said. Unlike previous agreements on Reko Diq, it seems that the new framework will be passed through the parliament and Supreme Court since both provincial and federal government enjoy higher share in the project (combined stake of 50 percent) against earlier share of 25 percent. Previously, it was feared that the net dollar inflows via copper-gold exports may be marginal due to thin stake by government of Pakistan. According to various sources, Pakistan has 5.9 billion tons of copper and 4.1 million ounces of gold reserves. However, inferred reserves (according to SMEC) would be around 12.3 million tons of copper and 20.9 million ounces of gold. \u201cWe believe that final reserve studies will be carried out by Barrick Gold which is the main operator of the mining project,\u201d he said. Considering the track records of the mining companies, they usually operate at 10-20 percent production ratio against their inferred reserve size. Based on inferred size of copper-gold reserves and lower production ratio of 3.0 percent, it is estimated that $5.0 billion worth of copper-gold seems to be logical target for the project companies in initial phase (against total copper-gold reserve size of over $150 billion at current price) which will largely be exported and benefit Pakistan through dollar inflows. The expedition is new for Pakistan and there is no proper study on local copper-gold mining and thus, no benchmark available, Farhan Mahmood said. However, considering the recent financial report by Barrick Gold, the operator has been in this field quite a long time and recent numbers revealed that the gold mining is a profitable business since company posted EBITDA margin of 61 percent in 2021 while gross margin was close to 41 percent, he added. For local E&Ps, though margins are currently higher in oil and gas business, but given volatility in international oil prices, circular debt risk and declining production, the mining venture seems more profitable in the longer run, he said. \u201cOur back of the envelope working suggest that if the project is able to extract only 3.0 percent of the inferred copper-gold reserve, OGDC\u2019s and PPL\u2019s earnings would improve by around Rs15 billion each on net basis i.e. after taking account opportunity cost (pre-tax EPS impact OGDC Rs4.0, PPL Rs 6.0 at current price of gold and copper),\u201d he said adding that this may re-rate long-term stock valuation of both the entities. \u201cHowever, OGDC and PPL share of investment would be around Rs30 billion each on an annualised basis which we believe would be easily invested if the government ensures raising local gas prices which will help in curtailing circular debt and liquidity issues. OGDC, in material information sent to PSX said that the board of directors of the Company has, on the basis of directions issued by the Federal Government, resolved to enter into a non-binding framework agreement with: the President of Islamic Republic of Pakistan on behalf of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the Governor Balochistan on behalf of the province of Balochistan, Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL), Government Holding (Private) Limited (GHPL) and Barrick Gold Corporation, which sets out inter alia the ownership/transaction structure, rights, obligations and common objectives of the parties towards facilitating the implementation of the reconstitution of a joint mining project at Reko Diq, on an expedited basis (the Project). Through the Framework Agreement, the Company has, in principle, agreed to participate in 8.33 percent equity (which may be held through onshore or offshore holding companies) along with PPL GHPL, in aggregate amounting to 25 percent of equity in the Project divided equally amongst the Company, PPL and GHPL. 50 percent of the equity will be held by Barrick who shall also have management and operator rights and remaining 25 percent of the equity will be held by the Government of Balochistan directly and/or through any of its owned entity, of which 10 percent shall be free carry of the Government of Balochistan, the material information said.

The report notes based on the receipt of Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA)\u2019s determination of June 3, 2022 on the annual Estimated Revenue Requirement (ERR) of gas companies- Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd (SSGCL) and Sui Northern Gas Pipeline Limited (SNGPL)-for financial year 2022, the government is now in the process of implementing more than the prescribed increase in consumer gas prices by end-August 2022 to contain the circular debt flow, address some of the circular debt stock, and improve the liquidity of the gas companies, while minimizing the impact on smaller consumers. The ERR for financial year 2022 determines an increase in the prescribed average end-user gas price by some 45 percent to Rs 928 per mmbtu. This will generate about Rs 666 billion for the gas companies which is Rs 120 billion higher than their ERR for financial year 2022. The surplus revenue would make up for the partial recovery of previous year\u2019s losses. On the regulatory side, the parliamentary adoption of the OGRA Act Amendments in March 2022 will support regular recovery requirements; however, government needs more time than granted in the amended OGRA Act (40 days) to work out the distribution of OGRA\u2019s annual ERR for financial year 2022 (determined in early June 2022) across the slab system.  The IMF has asked Pakistan to speed up efforts to establish reliable gas circular debt (CD) data, a circular debt Management Plan (CDMP) and CD projection capacity. The circular debt in the gas sector has increased from Rs 620 billion to Rs 719 billion in first three quarter (July-March) financial year 2021-22 (about 1 percent of GDP, with Rs 547 billion in system gas arrears and about Rs 172 billion in RLNG arrears).  The report highlighted that the main drivers of gas sector\u2019s circular debt are high unaccounted for gas losses (UFG), delayed sales price adjustments (since September 2020), uncovered subsidies (especially for export and zero-rated industries), and collection shortfalls. If gas companies\u2019 tax adjustments/ refunds, tariff-related recoveries stuck up in courts, and receivables of gas companies, Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL) and Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) from the power sector are included than the circular debt grows to over Rs 1,230 billion at end-March 2022. The report states that one of the main reasons for the accumulated shortfall in revenue is from a failure to cover costs due to the two gas companies (SSGCL and SNGPL) charging the \u2018sale price\u2019 set by the government rather than the \u2018prescribed price\u2019 by OGRA. The increase in the RLNG tariff differential and diversion costs mainly reflects the diversion of costly RLNG to domestic consumers during the last four winter seasons starting in financial year 2019-20 to financial year 2022 is another reason. The government has received early feedback from the World Bank and will continue working with the Bank on the mechanism for regular updates of the end-user gas price, while also rationalizing gas subsidies and implementing the structural pricing changes implied by the recently enacted weighted average cost of gas (WACOG) bill, the report says.

In addition to Mari Gas Field, it holds development and production leases as well as operatorship of exploration blocks, and is also a non-operating joint venture partner with leading national and international E&P companies D&P leases and exploration blocks. The government of Pakistan has over 18 percent shareholding in Mari Petroleum, with divestment plans on the cards since a long time that have recently been shelved now. Apart from that, Mari has two key shareholders: Fauji Foundation with 40 percent shareholding; and OGDCL with a share of 20 percent. Mari Petroleum Company Limited has witnessed rising crude oil production and relatively stable gas production flows over the last 6-7 years when the entire industry has been facing a slump. Its revenues and earnings have been on an upward trajectory too. In FY16, the revenues for MARI grew by 12 percent year-on-year due to sale of additional gas under incentive price provided to Guddu Power Station along with overall increased hydrocarbon production. At the same time, the exploration and prospecting expenditure doubled on a year-on-year basis. Good fortunes continued in FY17 as revenues continued to increase by 30 percent along with over 50 percent, year-on-year increase in earnings. Operating expenses continued to decline as it has been since FY12, while its production strategy has been to increase flows of oil and gas to take maximum benefit of the incentive offered in the 2012 Petroleum Policy on enhanced production of gas from the existing reservoirs, by at least 10 percent. In FY17, Mari Petroleum witnessed 18 billion cubic feet of incremental production. FY18 was a good year for production; the company witnessed highest ever production rates. At the same time profits were also record high at that time. During the year, total production was up by 5 percent year-on-year in FY18 along with incremental production as planned. The company\u2019s gross sales exceeded Rs100 billion for the first time in the history of the company. Its net profit jumped by 68 percent year-on-year where other income also lent support to the bottomline. Crude oil prices were high in FY19, which along with currency depreciation raised the earnings of the E&P companies. MARI too announced a hefty increase in its earnings for FY19 \u2013 58.2 percent year-on-year due to increase in net sales and finance income, and somewhat controlled operating expenditure. Growth of 17.5 percent year-on-year in gross sales came from better gas volumes sold as well as increase in wellhead/consumer gas price. And the increase in exchange gains further lifted the bottomline. Growth in profits however, was cut short by increase in royalty expenses and exploration and prospecting expenditure, which were higher due to higher drilling activity. FY20 was a difficult year as depressed oil prices for the oil and gas and the pandemic impacted exploration and production companies. Mari Petroleum\u2019s gross sales increased by around 8 percent, while the net revenue of the company was up by almost 21 percent, year-on-year. Growth in the company\u2019s revenues was solely due to the increase of around 20 percent in gas wellhead prices and currency depreciation. Oil and gas production were down by 8 and 2 percent year-on-year respectively during the year. Its bottomline grew by over 24 percent year-on-year. Where revenue growth helped boost earnings for Mari Petroleum, higher exploration and production expenses during the year contained the growth. The company witnessed 2.5 times increase in exploration and prospecting expenses. FY21 was better as compared to FY20, which also showed in the E&P sector\u2019s performance. Mari Petroleum Company Limited announced a 4 percent increase in its earnings for FY21. Where the 1HFY21 posted growth in earnings, the company\u2019s earnings slipped slightly in 3QFY21 due to drop in oil prices negatively impacting the gas wellhead prices. This was followed by another positive last quarter despite the drop in oil prices continuing. Despite the weakness in prices, topline growth for Mari was supported by better hydrocarbon production flows in FY21. Mari\u2019s overall oil production in FY21 stood up by 17 percent year-on-year, while natural gas production was up by 8 percent year-on-year during the year. The growth in E&P\u2019s earnings was fueled by weaker exploration and production expenses. However, drop in other income and rise in finance cost did the opposite. The fate of the E&P sector\u2019s earning largely rests with not only higher international crude oil prices and currency depreciation but also higher domestic oil and gas production. With reserves depleting and discoveries turning in smaller, the E&P sector is facing a challenge on the production front, which could be addressed with invigorating investor interest and technology transfer in the domestic upstream sector by reviewing and revising policies. After a stable start to FY22 in the first quarter, the overall gross sales growth for 1HFY22 was 11.6 percent year-on-year. 1HFY22 net sales were higher by 8 percent year-on-year where overall oil production grew by 35 percent, while gas production was up by around 2-3 percent year-on-year. The topline also benefitted from higher oil prices during the period. However, Mari wellhead gas price was seen slipping. Improvement in Mari\u2019s production volumes have been seen during FY21 that seems to have continued in FY22. On the expenses side, the rise in royalty expense was offset by a decline in operating expenditure and exploration and prospecting expenditure. The decline in exploration cost came from lower cost of dry and abandoned wells during 1HFY22 versus corresponding period. Both rise in topline and lower exploration expenses benefit the bottomline of an E&P company. And in Mari\u2019s case, this was more visible in the earnings growth, which was otherwise bogged down by significant share of loss from associates. Also, higher taxation left the bottomline for Mari flat in 1HFY22.

The company won two exploration blocks namely, Block-28 North and D.I. Khan West Block. Both the blocks are in highly prospective zones as proved by three recent gas discoveries of OGDCL around Block-28 North and discovery of Wali-1 well near D.I. Khan West Block. In near future, successful discoveries in both blocks will positively contribute to mitigate energy demand and supply gap from indigenous resources. OKTA Group is not only working in hydrocarbon exploration, but its scope of work is extended to become a fully integrated E&P player of the region with medium term plans of establishing its own oil refinery and oil marketing setup. Similarly, OKTA GOC is going to install petrochemical plant for the separation of other useful chemicals from extracted hydrocarbons. Long term plan of the company is to invest over $1 billion in the next 10 years. No doubt this huge investment within the country will create employment opportunities at different levels in oil & gas sector.  At the same time, the company looks forward to bring international investors into Pakistan\u2019s Oil & Gas sector, as Investors from Russia & Saudi Arabia are showing interest for JV partnership in this area. The vision of the company runs parallel to Pakistan\u2019s goal of becoming self-reliant in energy resources by discovering new horizons innovatively and sustainably.

The FKPCL is an Independent Power Producer (IPP) under the Power Policy 1994, with an installed capacity of 157 MW in the combined cycle steam turbine mode located near Kabirwala, in Khanewal district. The power plant consumes the low BTU gas commingled with pipeline quality gas, in certain ratios.  The project achieved the Financial Close on June 2, 1996 and Commercial Operations Date on October 21, 1999.  Term of the PPA and IA is for 30 years from the COD, whereas the term of the GSA was 15 years from the COD and there was an inherent mismatch of duration between the contract documents due to the non-commitment of availability and supply of gas by the gas producer and gas supplier.  The term of the GSA (upon extension by the ECC) has expired since March 31, 2015 and it has been replaced with Tripartite Agreement (TPA) which is a stop gap/ interim arrangement between the company, the gas suppliers and power purchaser till the time gas supply agreement is executed for the remainder of the term of the PPA. The GoP through the TPA has allocated RLNG on \"as and when\" available basis. According to the power firm, between years 2000, 2006 and 2015 from time to time, the ECC/ GoP and its entities have been deliberating and allocating additional supplies of gas from the alternate sources like Bahu gas field, Qadirpur gas field, as well as, pipeline quality gas for the project to maintain prescribed heating/ calorific value to ensure guaranteed efficiency.  Several MoUs with limited duration of one year were signed between the Company and the OGDCL for allocation of low BTU gas from its gas fields but no long-term/ sustainable solution seems to materialize in form of gas allocation or extended GSA. The company has claimed that it was also recommended by the Power Division/ GoP that the GSA should be extended for another term of fifteen years so as to match with and commensurate with the term of PPA; however, to no avail.  The ECC, in its decision of July 23, 2014 did allocate low BTU gas from the gas fields of the OGDCL and pipeline quality gas from the SNGPL network for the remaining term of the PPA with a direction to execute the GSA on the said terms of allocation and subsequently the ECC again on January 23, 2015 directed full supply of gas on firm basis and extension of GSA but it was seemingly not or partially implemented and somehow the company was reallocated RLNG. The power company noted that gas supply failure meaning the non-availability of low BTU has from the gas fields and or pipeline quality gas in the requisite amounts for the operation and dispatch of the complex is a Pakistan political force majeure event under the IA and PPA. Pursuant to clause F (3) of the Power Policy 1994, in case the fuel is to be supplied by a public sector organization, the performance of the fuel supplier will be guaranteed by the GoP under the terms of Fuel Supply Agreement (FSA). Company Secretary, in his letter also claimed that it is further acknowledged and agreed by the parties the term of the GSA in case of gas supply failure which commences when the complex is unable to operate at the required availability due to non-availability of gas in the requisite amounts under the GSA as a result of reserve failure (depletion of the Nandpur field and the Panjpir field) and or nationwide shortage of supply of pipeline quantity gas. He has further claimed that the parties have agreed to identify for alternate or additional supplies of low-BTU gas from future reserves that are developed by the gas supplier or by another federal entity in the area of the Complex or secure additional supplies of pipeline quantity gas or combination of both. According to the power firm, TPA being an interim arrangement for the supply of RLNG, is void for uncertainty and concluded in breach of the directions of GoP for firm allocation on take or pay basis, does not fulfil the obligations required of the GoP under the IA to provide for requisite amounts of gas or to effect gas supply change and it further unilaterally changes a gas supply failure being a Pakistan political Force Majeure Event (FME)  under the IA and the PPA to the Other Force Majeure Event (OFME).  Relying on the provisions of the IA, the Company has invoked the relevant applicable provisions of the IA to ensure uninterrupted firm supply of gas in the requisite amounts at commercially reasonable terms for the dispatch and operation of the power plant. The company has requested PPIB/ GoP to convene the meeting of experts for deliberation on the gas supply change under the applicable terms of the IA read with the PPA.

In addition to Mari Gas Field, it holds development and production leases as well as operatorship of exploration blocks, and is also a non-operating joint venture partner with leading national and international E&P companies D&P leases and exploration blocks. Starting of as a key supplier of gas to the fertilizer manufacturers, it also is a supplier of gas to the power generation companies and gas distribution companies; while its crude oil and condensate are supplied to the refineries. The government of Pakistan has around 18.39 percent shareholding in Mari Petroleum, with divestment plans on the cards since a long time that have recently been shelved now. Apart from that, Mari has two key shareholders: Fauji Foundation with 40 percent shareholding; and OGDCL with a share of 20 percent. Over the last few years, Mari Petroleum Company Limited has seen rising crude oil production and relatively stable gas production flows. Its revenues and earnings have been on an upward trajectory over the past 6-7 years. In FY16, the revenues increased by 12 percent year-on-year due to sale of 60 mmcfd additional gas under incentive price provided to Guddu Power Station along with overall increased hydrocarbon production. At the same time, the exploration and prospecting expenditure increases two times on a year-on-year basis. FY17 was another good year as revenues continued to increase by 30 percent along with 51 percent, year-on-year increase in incomes. The company\u2019s performance over the years had seen its operating expenditure come down consistently - from 46 percent of sales in FY12 to 26 percent in FY17. The company\u2019s strategy has been to increase production of oil and gas to take maximum benefit of the incentive offered in the 2012 Petroleum Policy on enhanced production of gas from the existing reservoirs, by at least 10 percent. In FY17, Mari Petroleum witnessed 18 billion cubic feet of incremental. In FY18 the company witnessed highest ever production rates and profits. During the year, MARI made one new hydrocarbon discovery in its operated blocks and also completed one appraisal and one development well during the year. In terms of production, Total production as up by 5 percent year-on-year in FY18. The company was able to further enhance incremental production as planned. The company\u2019s gross sales exceeded Rs100 billion for the first time in the history of the company. Its net profit jumped by 68 percent year-on-year. In addition, the finance income also supported the earnings for FY18. FY19saw higher crude oil prices on average. But what has been the key factor to increase the oil and gas exploration and production companies\u2019 profitability was the currency depreciation. Mari Petroleum Company Limited announced a hefty increase in its earnings for FY19 \u2013 58.2 percent year-on-year due to increase in net sales and finance income, and somewhat controlled operating expenditure. Growth of 17.5 percent year-on-year in gross sales came from better gas volumes sold as well as increase in wellhead/consumer gas price. And the increase in exchange gains further lifted the bottomline. Growth in profits however, was cut short by increase in royalty expenses and exploration and prospecting expenditure, which were higher due to higher drilling activity. FY20 was marked by the impact of Covid-19 and depressed oil prices for the oil and gas exploration and production companies. Mari Petroleum\u2019s gross sales increased by around 8 percent. Adjusted for taxes, cess and duties, the net revenue of the company was up by almost 21 percent year-on-year. Growth in the company\u2019s revenues was solely due to the increase of around 20 percent in gas wellhead prices and currency depreciation. Oil and gas production were down by 8 and 2 percent year-on-year respectively during the year. Its bottomline grew by over 24 percent year-on-year. Where revenue growth helped boost earnings for Mari Petroleum, higher exploration and production expenses during the year contained the growth. The company witnessed 2.5 times increase in exploration and prospecting expenses. FY21 in comparison to FY20 came with some revival in the E&P landscape. Mari Petroleum Company Limited announced a 4 percent increase in its earnings for FY21. Where the 1HFY21 posted growth in earnings, the company\u2019s earnings slipped slightly in 3QFY21 due to drop in oil prices negatively impacting the gas wellhead prices. This was followed by another positive last quarter despite the drop in oil prices continuing. However, in spite of the weakness in prices, topline growth was supported by better hydrocarbon production flows in FY21. Mari\u2019s overall oil production in FY21 stood up by 17 percent year-on-year, while natural gas production was up by 8 percent year-on-year during the year. The growth in E&P\u2019s earnings was fueled by weaker exploration and production expenses that declined due to absence of dry well. However, drop in other income and rise in finance cost did the opposite. The E&P giant kept it stable as FY22 began. The decline in gas wellhead prices was offset by rise in gas production. With a share of 21 percent in the country\u2019s gas production, Mari\u2019s gas volumes grew by one percent year-on-year. The oil production for Mari Petroleum was up by over 60 percent year-on-year. Mari Petroleum\u2019s revenue for 1QFY22 was up by 2 percent year-on-year, while its bottomline was flat at Rs9 billion. Exploration and prospecting expenditure was another factor in restricting earnings growth for the company. The E&P expenses grew by 43 percent year-on-year during the quarter, which also increased exploration expenses\u2019 share in total revenue from 6 percent in 1QFY21 to 8.4 percent in 1QFY22. Mari also recorded other income of Rs18 million in 1QFY22 against other expense of Rs507 million in 1QFY21. The company has diversified into mining business by investing in National Resources (Pvt.) Ltd (NRL), where MPCL shareholding in the project is 20 percent. The company also won the offshore exploration license in Block 5 of Abu Dhabi as part of the consortium with ADNOC where the first spud in the block is expected to commence in FY23.

Noor Alam Khan chaired the meeting which examined the audit report of the Petroleum Division for the year 2019-20.  Responding to a question raised by Member Committee Rohail Asghar that the government of Saudi Arabia should be approached for an exemption on mandatory four to five percent interest rate charged by international banks as guarantees against Letters of Credit (LCs) so that Pakistan State Oil (PSO) or other public sector refinery could import crude oil from Saudi Arabia on reduced prices. The Petroleum Division Secretary replied that it was one of the requirements in all commercial agreements which could not be renegotiated; otherwise Saudi Arabia had to renegotiate all commercial contracts with other countries. He maintained that the federal government was importing oil from Qatar on credit facility of 80 days and LCs were opened on spot purchase. Pakistan was importing crude and refined fuel from various countries on long-term contracts, he added. He further revealed that the Petroleum Division was formulating a policy to give an extension of licences to the oil and gas exploration companies on the condition that they would resume their operations. Many of the foreign companies wind up their operation in Pakistan, he added. The committee further directed the Secretary Petroleum to probe into claims of the previous Government of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) that Russia was ready to supply oil at cheaper rates. Member Committee from the PTI Syed Shibli Faraz recommended the secretary to find out any initial discussion between Pakistan and Russian available in written on oil import. Responding to another question regarding local oil and gas production, the secretary said that Oil and Gas Development Company (OGDCL) and Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) and other exploration and production companies had suspended their operations in various places as they did not have investment as the circular debt of oil and gas reached to Rs1.5 trillion and reliance on imported fuel was increasing. The Chairman Committee observed that one of the reasons that contributed to a decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) in the oil and gas sector was the lengthy process of the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) awarding licenses to a company. He said OGRA was creating hurdles in the inflow of foreign investment in the oil and gas sector and was not resolving their issues. The secretary said, \u201cYes, it is a perception about the OGRA but everyone has his own opinion\u201d. During the audit of the PSO for the financial year 2014-17, an audit report pointed out that it was observed that claims of Rs2.1 billion on account of the IFEM could not be got settled from the OGRA due to non-conducting of IFEM audit since 2012.

A new agreement was signed by representatives of the federal and Balochistan governments with a delegation of Barrick Gold, led by Chief Executive Dr. Mark Bristow. As per the terms of the new agreement, the Reko Diq project would be revived and developed by Barrick Gold in partnership with Pakistani entities. The new project will be owned 50 percent by Barrick Gold and the remaining 50 percent shareholding will be owned by Pakistan, divided equally between federal government and the provincial government of Balochistan. Federal government\u2019s 25 percent shareholding will be divided equally amongst three state-owned-entities (SOEs) \u2013 Oil & Gas Development Corporation Limited (OGDCL), Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) and Government Holdings Pakistan Limited (GHPL).

As part of the Prime Minister\u2019s vision for Balochistan, the government of Balochistan\u2019s share of capital and operating expenses for the project will be borne by the federal government which means provincial government would not incur any expenses in development of the mines. For developing the project, nearly US$ 10 billion would be invested in Balochistan, including US$ 1 billion that will be invested in social uplift projects such as roads, schools, hospitals and creation of technical training institute for mining. The investment will create over 8000 new jobs. This project will make Balochistan the largest recipient of foreign direct investment in Pakistan and the Reko Diq project will be one of the largest copper and gold mining projects in the world. To ensure optimal utilization of nation\u2019s mineral wealth the government is also considering setting up a smelter. The agreement was reached after several rounds of negotiations over the last three years. In August 2019, the Prime Minister had set up a committee to steer the negotiations with an aim for early development of the mines. In this effort, the federal and provincial governments were assisted by international advisors. To ensure the deal is compliant with all the laws, the government would submit the matter before the parliament and the Supreme Court. While speaking at the occasion, the Prime Minister stressed on the emphasis his government places on development of Balochistan and uplift of underdeveloped areas. He expressed hope that the investment will change the quality of lives of ordinary citizens in Balochistan. He appreciated the efforts of the negotiating team for a transparent and favourable agreement for the people of Balochistan. Earlier, the delegation of Barrick Gold Corporation called on the Prime Minister. Canadian High Commissioner to Pakistan Wendy Gilmour was also present. Later, addressing a news conference Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin along with the Minister for Energy Hammad Azhar and Chief Minister Balochistan Abdul Quddus Bizenjo stated that that an award of $5.9 billion was given against Pakistan with per day fine of $700 million. Along with that London Court of Arbitration also opened a case against government of Balochistan and $4 billion dollar is ready against Pakistan. Tarin said that if the government had not reached an agreement, Pakistan would have to pay $11 billion. He further stated that after since 2019, the prime minister pursued solution of the problem and an Apex body was formed which made a deal with previous company at $900 million which nullified their claim of $3.25 billion. Finance Minister said that Barrick Gold said it would continue in the project with 50percent share, adding that 25 percent has been given to the Balochistan without taking any money from the province and remaining 25 percent shareholders are SOEs \u2013 PPL, OGDCL and GHPL.

In addition to Mari Gas Field, it holds development and production leases as well as operatorship of exploration blocks, and is also a non-operating joint venture partner with leading national and international E&P companies D&P leases and exploration blocks. Mari has two key shareholders: Fauji Foundation with 40 percent shareholding; and OGDCL with a share of 20 percent. The government of Pakistan has a shareholding of over 18 percent in Mari Petroleum, with divestment plans on the cards since a long time that have recently been shelved now. Mari Petroleum Company Limited has witnessed rising crude oil production and relatively stable gas production flows over the past 7 years when the entire industry had been facing a slump. The company\u2019s revenues and earnings have been on an upward route too. The revenues for MARI in FY16 grew by 12 percent year-on-year due to sale of additional gas under incentive price provided to Guddu Power Station along with overall increased hydrocarbon production. At the same time, the exploration and prospecting expenditure doubled on a year-on-year basis. Revenues continued to increase by 30 percent in FY17 along with 50 percent, year-on-year increase in earnings. Operating expenses continued to decline while Mari Petroleum witnessed 18 billion cubic feet of incremental gas production during the year as its production strategy has been to increase flows of oil and gas to take maximum benefit of the incentive offered in the 2012 Petroleum Policy. In FY18, the company witnessed highest ever production rates. At the same time profits were also record high at that time. During the year, total production was up by 5 percent year-on-year in FY18 along with incremental production. The company\u2019s gross sales exceeded Rs100 billion for the first time, and its net profit jumped by 68 percent year-on-year where other income also supported to the bottomline. FY19 was a year of high oil prices and along with currency depreciation, MARI\u2019s earnings benefitted with an increase of over 58 percent year-on-year. Growth in earnings was also due to increase finance income, and somewhat controlled operating expenditure. Growth in profits however, was cut short by increase in royalty expenses and exploration and prospecting expenditure, which were higher due to higher drilling activity. FY20 was a difficult year as depressed oil prices for the oil and gas and the pandemic impacted exploration and production activities due to fall in demand. However, Mari Petroleum\u2019s gross sales increased by around 8 percent, while the net revenue of the company was up by almost 21 percent year-on-year. Growth in the company\u2019s revenues was solely due to the increase of around 20 percent in gas wellhead prices and currency depreciation. Oil and gas production were down by 8 and 2 percent year-on-year respectively during the year. Its profits grew by over 24 percent year-on-year. Higher exploration and production expenses by 2.5 times during the year contained the growth. Mari Petroleum Company Limited announced a 4 percent increase in its earnings for FY21. Despite the weakness in prices, topline growth for Mari was supported by better hydrocarbon production flows in FY21. Mari\u2019s oil production in FY21 stood higher by 17 percent year-on-year, while natural gas production was up by 8 percent year-on-year. The growth in earnings was powered by weaker exploration and production expenses. However, drop in other income and rise in finance cost impacted adversely/ MARI\u2019s performance in 9MFY22 improved further as higher oil prices and increased production lifted overall net sales. Revenues were up by 22 percent, while earnings were up by 18 percent year-on-year. In general, the company has been facing low gas off take by the power sector as well as by fertilizer sector due to emergency shutdowns and unplanned turnarounds. However, the company has been able to keep up with production oil production 13 percent year-on-year. During 9MFY22, the company\u2019s gas production also increased by 4 percent year-on-year due to the export of volumes towards the SNGPL network. The fate of the E&P sector\u2019s earning largely rests with higher international crude oil prices and currency depreciation and also higher domestic oil and gas production. However, with reserves depleting and discoveries turning in smaller, the E&P sector is facing a challenge on the production front. However, the year is likely to end on a better note due to company\u2019s less exposure to circular debt, incremental production, currency depreciation, and oil prices.

In the meantime, CPPA-G Board decided that PPIB may opt to terminate the Implementation Agreement (IA) of EPQL and the project be handed over to some entity nominated by the government of Pakistan for its operation. EPQL expressed its interest for 25-55 MMCFD gas from Kandhkot and requested PPIB\u2019s support for it. NEPRA in its suo moto proceedings on unavailability of power plants, directed to make urgent efforts for making Kandhkot gas available to EPQL. OGDCL has also shared the tentative Qadirpur PG availability profile up to 2035- 36, according to which 32 to 6 MMCFD PG would be available for remaining 14 years. As advised by OGDCL, more than 50% of the recycled PG is recoverable whereas remaining PG is to be vented. The estimated revenue loss to gas supplier for vented gas is approx. Rs20 billion up to 2035. Considering the latest PG availability profile which was earlier expected to reach minimum level by 2017-18 whereas the actual gas availability was better, the option of maintaining the status quo so as to utilize the maximum possible available PG for next few months/ years can also be exercised. On invitation of Managing Director, PPIB Shah Jahan Mirza, a presentation was given by a representative of CPPA-G. Representative Planning Division opined that analysis of both CPPA-G and NTDC suggest that EPQL will get despatch till 2025, with no significant loss that can even be overcome considering safety margins and spinning reserves requirement in the system. Regarding buy-back or termination of project, it was discussed that it will lead to project transfer to some GoP entity like GENCOs, which may result in inappropriate O&M considering their experiences in other projects, besides arrangement of funding for plant modification/ pipeline. Moreover, such an arrangement will not be in line with the GoP focus on power sector transition towards management by private sector for efficiency enhancement. The project has also got an added advantage of black start facility, as was highlighted earlier by NTDC. It was also discussed that the project as running has the capability of being run for next few years in status quo; it will be of importance for power and energy security. The Project Committee also deliberated on alternate gas supply arrangement for the project like Kandhkot. Representative Planning Division highlighted that there are other avenues of Kandhkot gas utilization being examined, thus it is not certain whether this gas can be allocated to EPQL, at this stage. It was also discussed that the option can be explored further to ascertain viability and availability for using Kandhkot gas by EPQL for power generation.  The Committee agreed that under prevailing economic conditions, where power generation is highly reliant on imported fuels, flaring of indigenous gas would not be prudent. Moreover, flaring is not the desired option considering its environmental implications. Based on viewpoint of different stakeholders, the Committee discussed recommending that the project may operate on comingled RLNG with available permeate gas till 2025 and re-evaluation be done in 2025 for further operation of the project. EPQL would be asked to make necessary arrangements in this respect like plant modification, pipeline laying, etc., at its own cost. Representative of Government of Punjab opined that EPQL is working at around 45% efficiency, whereas there are other projects available which are operating at above 60% efficiency. In such a situation, EPQL does not appear a feasible option. Representative Planning Division explained that since EPQL is getting flare gas for comingling, its weighted average cost of fuel would be lower and thus its tariff is expected to be lesser as compared to other plants. Moreover, the EPQL will be despatched on merit order.  MD PPIB added that even current provision of 50% minimum despatch will not be applicable and 100% merit order based despatch will be done if GDMP/ GDMO is implemented as minimum take-or-pay provision will not be carried forward. After detailed discussion the Committee recommended that GDMPT/GDMO) for EPQL Power Plant, with the following terms and conditions: (i) EPQL will utilize RLNG as the comingling fuel with available Qadirpur permeate gas or HSD, as the case may be; (ii) term of the GDMP/GDMO shall be for a period up to December 31, 2025;(iii) EPQL power plant will be dispatched on economic merit order taking into consideration following criteria in the order of priority (a) on PG, to the extent of its availability, (b) on comingled PG and R-LNG till the time PG remains available, (c)on RLNG only when PG is completely depleted or not available; and (d) on HSD, as secondary/ backup fuel, when R-LNG is not available. There will be no provision of minimum dispatch or guaranteed off \u2018take on any fuel in the PPA; (iv) all CAPEX and other associated costs to be incurred in relation to implementation of GDMO will be exclusively incurred by EPQL, with no liability or obligation of GOP, Power Purchaser or any other GOP entity under the respective project agreements; (v) EPQL will obtain approval of supplemental tariff with respect to fuel cost component from NEPRA for operating the plant on comingled RLNG; (vi) the project agreements (IA, PPA, GSA) will be amended to the extent necessary to give effect to GDMP/GDMO with the provision that GoP shall have unfettered right to terminate the IA on or after January 1, 2026 as if no GDMP/ GDMO were taken place. Operational details will be finalized through discussions under the relevant agreements;(vii) RLNG will be supplied by SNGPL on \u201cas and when available\u201d basis; (viii) arrangement will be implemented within minimum possible time, for which EPQL will liaise with SNGPL to reduce the period for pipeline laying and infrastructure development; (ix) any plant shut down for modification  will be made in the scheduled outage period and there will be no additional outages allowed for implementation of this arrangement and (a) EPQL will be approached for confirmation  on above GDMP/GDMO, before submitting the matter for approval by the PPIB Board, (b) EPQL project will be re-evaluated in 2025  to assess  the financial viability and suitability of the EPQL project for power system, considering available fuel resources and dispatch analysis, and (c) option of using Kandhkot gas by EPQL for power generation, to ascertain its viability and availability will simultaneously will be explored further.

Therefore, any amount deposited/set aside by the SOEs under this may immediately be deposited in the Federal Consolidated Fund,\u201d said the Finance Ministry in a letter to Privatisation Commission and other concerned Ministries/Entities. The Finance Ministry maintains that during a number of meetings held in Finance Division, attended by the key Ministries and SOEs, it was agreed by the SOEs that BESOS amount will be settled through cash deposit or non-cash adjustment. However, the action by the concerned is still awaited. According to sources, the Finance Division has maintained that it is under significant fiscal pressure to meet the budgetary shortfall during CFY, urging Ministries that concerned SOEs may be directed to deposit the BESOS balance in Federal Consolidated Fund immediately. On April 22, 2022, Secretary PC, Hassan Nasir Jamy in a letter to Secretary Finance, cited the reference of his earlier letter of February 14, 2022 wherein the short order of October 22, 2020 passed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the appeals titled C.A.421/2018, 422/2018 & 423/2018 in which the Benazir Employees Stock Option Scheme was declared unconstitutional, was highlighted.  He said, in various meetings held in the Finance Division with the concerned Ministries/Entities such as OGDCL and PPL, etc, the entities argued that the amounts cannot be transferred in the Consolidated Fund of the federal government in the absence of the detailed order to be passed by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has now passed the detailed order declaring BESOS as a scheme executed in breach of Article 154 of the constitution. The operative para of the detailed order is as follows:  \u201cin view of our discussion above, where the very scheme has been found to be against Article 154 of the Constitution, we set aside the judgment of November 24, 2016 passed by the Islamabad High Court in ICA| No. 292 to 294 of 2016 and uphold the judgment of January 3, 2018 passed by the High Court of Sindh in Constitution petition No. 1837 of 2014.\u201d \u201cPrivatisation Commission through its legal wing had vigorously pursued the case in the Supreme Court of Pakistan leading to the final decision in favour of Government of Pakistan that may result in an addition of over Rs.30 billion in the Consolidated Fund,\u201d said Secretary PC. According to Jamy, the Central Revolving Fund maintained by Privatisation Commission has been closed since, 2020 and all concerned Ministries have already been requested through PC\u2019s OM of December 30, 2020 to deposit amount retained on account of Employees Empower Trust (EET) in the Federal Consolidated Fund. Secretary PC has requested Finance Division to issue following necessary directions to the concerned Ministries/Entities: (i) transfer of amounts in EET directly in the Federal Consolidated Fund maintained by the Finance Division pursuant to the decision of Federal Cabinet on March 29, 2019; and (ii) winding up or revocation of EET\u2019s as may be advised by the Law and Justice Division in the light of the order passed by the Supreme Court in this regard. On April 9, 2019, the Federal Cabinet made the following decision regarding BESOS: (i) whereas the deciding of case by courts may take some time, an amount of Rs 28.004 billion is lying stuck in EET\u2019s including Rs 117.601 million with the Privatisation Commission, may be returned to the Federal Consolidated Fund # 1 being federal government\u2019s share of dividends; (ii) no amount may be transferred to any bank account henceforth on account of BESOS; and (iii) Privatisation Commission may initiate the case for winding up of BESOS. According to the Finance Division, the Federal Cabinet, on the directives of the then President, in its meeting held on August 5, 2009 approved BESOS, offering 12 per cent of GoP share to the employees of 80 State Owned Entities as an arrangement to empower the employees. The scheme envisaged that 12 per cent of GoP share of amount received from dividends was to be divided into two options - 50 per cent to be credited to Central Revolving Fund (CRF) maintained by the Privatisation Commission which was to be used for payments of buyback claims on the pre-defined criteria; and 50 per cent was kept by the EETs for distribution amongst the employees of respective entities. To implement the scheme, EETs were created amongst 236,306 employees in 59 SOEs, however, in spirit, the scheme could become effective for over 23 SOEs only.

It is appreciable that the government is also considering setting up a smelter to ensure optimal utilization of the nation\u2019s mineral wealth. It is a right step in the right direction that the Balochistan government would not incur any expenses in development of the mines after this agreement. Its share of expenses shall be borne by the federal government. In developing the project, nearly $10 billion will be invested in Balochistan, including $1 billion for social uplift projects \u2014 roads, schools, hospitals and creation of technical training institute for mining. The investment will create over 8,000 new jobs. He said Reko Diq would potentially be the largest gold and copper mine in the world and it will liberate Pakistan from crippling debt and usher in a new era of development and prosperity. The businessmen congratulate the nation and people of Balochistan on successful agreement with Barrick Gold for development of Reko Diq mine after 10 years of legal battles and negotiations, he said. Penalty of approximately $11 billion is offset while $10 billion will be invested in Balochistan creating 8,000 new jobs, he added. Anjum Nisar said some $10 billion would be invested in the province under this project, creating 8,000 new jobs for the locals. The government was actively engaged with Tethyan Copper Company \u2014 a consortium between the Canadian based mining company Barrick Gold and Chile\u2019s Antofagasta to work specifically on the Reko Diq project \u2014 to reach a settlement as the country was threatened with facing a penalty of $6.5 billion because of its top court\u2019s decision to deny a mining lease to the firm. According to settlement, 50% of the new project\u2019s shares will be owned by Barrick Gold, while the remaining shares shall be owned by Pakistan, divided equally between the Centre and the Balochistan government. The federal government\u2019s shares of 25% will be divided equally among three state-owned entities \u2014 namely the Oil and Gas Development Corporation Limited (OGDCL), Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL), and Government Holdings Pakistan Limited (GHPL). As per the terms of the new agreement, the Reko Diq project will be revived and developed by Barrick Gold in partnership with Pakistani entities.  The agreement has been reached after several rounds of negotiations over the last three years. In August 2019, the prime minister had set up a committee to steer the negotiations with an aim for early development of the mines. In this effort, the federal and provincial governments were assisted by international advisors including a law firm, White & Case, and an investment bank, Lazard. To ensure the deal is compliant with all the laws, the government will submit the matter before parliament and the Supreme Court. It has been learnt that future governments would continue this project wherein $100 billion would be earned. On July 29, 1993, the BHP Minerals (BHP) and the Balochistan Development Authority (BDA) had signed the Chagai Hills Exploration Joint Venture Agreement (CHEJVA).

We can produce only power from these resources so there will be no change in the cost and fluctuation in money,\u201d said Shahab, adding that local resources give greater control on fuel cost \u2014 the biggest issue. \u201cLuckily we have all these three options. We are blessed. Thar coal was a dream sometime back and now it is being utilized for the last four years,\u201d said Shahab. He said Sindh is energy capital where Thar has coal, Jhimpir has wind, and Ghotki and surrounding areas have good low BTU gas reserves. He said power policies should liberalize markets and local fuels should be incentivized. Currently Pakistan has 60% imported fuel and 40% local in its energy mix while it should be around 80% to 85% local and just 15% imported.  \u201cOur policies should keep the risk of selling power with the developers so that they go for local fuels,\u201d said Shahab, adding that currently we are paying to foreign fuel resources instead of funding our own resources. He added that power policies from 1994 allowed private investment thus IPPs for 20 to 22 thousand MWs with 60 to 70 billion dollar investment did come to Pakistan but unfortunately most of them were projects based on imported fuel. \u201cSo it was an interesting situation of a commodity that has local consumption with imported raw material,\u201d said Shahab, adding that one study shows that Pakistan imported fuel worth $85 billion dollars since 1994. Shahab said that Pakistan has foreign debt of around $84 billion yet, unfortunately, Pakistan spent borrowings from the IMF on luxury items and power projects run on imported fuels. \u201cThe policy should have support for indigenization of fuel options. India and China adopted this indigenous fuel option to eradicate poverty while Bangladesh is also following this trend,\u201d said Shahab. He added that Bangladesh\u2019s government is subsidizing their industry, not the domestic consumers, but here in Pakistan subsidy is given on domestic consumption. \u201cThe Bangladesh\u2019s industry then pays back to the government through employment, taxes, and exports,\u201d said Shahab, adding Bangladesh\u2019s industry generates dollars through exports and pays for their imported fuel. But, he added, in Pakistan the problem is that imported fuel is used for power generation and the consumption is domestic despite that local and renewable fuel options have lots of potential to help Pakistan achieve its economic goals. \u201cSo, instead of spending 8 to 9 billion dollars, which is now 15 billion, on importing fuel, we should use local fuel options to get rid of the IMF,\u201d reasoned Shahab. He said that receivables are the biggest issue for the local power sector and payments from the government are slow; therefore, the situation on liquidity is vulnerable. \u201cIn order to stop the rise in fuel cost the government has to indigenize fuel options. They can do balloon payments to the sector and use cheaper fuel and this is a long-term solution,\u201d said Shahab.  He briefed about the Qadirpur project of Engro which was conceived in 2006 under power policy 2002 and it was commissioned in 2010. \u201cThe project performed far better than expectations. The projection was to produce 8 to 10 billion units but in the last two years we produced 60% more results with 16 billion units and now 6 billion more can be produced,\u201d said Shahab. He said that the EPQL project generated 80 billion rupees from nothing for OGDCL and if this project were not commissioned the government would have spent $1.3 billion on an RFO plant. When asked about challenges to this project, Shahab said that the challenges are depletion of reserves as every local gas project faces this challenge. \u201cNow the options are to look for more reserves in the area after 2018. Currently, we are producing 110MWs from 32mmcf gas while the remaining 100MWs is being produced from HSD,\u201d said Shahab. He said that they proposed a solution to the government to connect the plant with RLNG as the annual impact is of Rs 13 billion if production is done through RNLG instead of HSD. \u201cWe also requested the government to give us gas from Kandhkot so that we can continue producing power at Rs 7-8 per unit,\u201d said Shahab. He added that they can produce 800 million units this way to save Rs 20 billion per month and this saving can be utilized to fund a pipeline to the EPQL (pipeline cost is Rs 2 billion and can be laid down in three months). \u201cWe have asked the government to give us this gas on \u2018as and when\u2019 basis. Only 3-4 months are required for this solution and the economy can start having benefits,\u201d said Shahab. He said they have talked to the Ministry of Petroleum and are expecting an early decision in this regard because this solution will lessen the burden on Forex reserves and reduce circular debt. \u201cAny energy that is cheaper eases circular debt. Also, this is PKR transaction as dollars are being replaced with local currency,\u201d said Shahab. To a question about the unavailability of both RNLG and gas from Kandhkot, he said that gas from Kandhkot should be available because HSD is always expensive. \u201cThe 95% plant will be run on gas from Kandhkot. And we don\u2019t even seek any commitment from the government in this regard like gas can be given to the plant on an availability basis,\u201d said Shahab. He said that EPQL can potentially produce 23 billion units of electricity over its remaining Power Purchasing Agreement (PPA) term till 2035, which will result in a potential benefit of over Rs. 300 billion to the consumers over the next 13 years. \u201cThe 23 billion units can provide foreign exchange savings of up to $2 billion versus imported coal/ fuel,\u201d said Shahab, adding that it can also result in potential revenue of Rs 150 billion for Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) or the government till 2035. \u201cThe plant would need Rs 450 to 550 billion for running on the imported fuel for the next 13 years. This is the reason this allocation of gas to EPQL is very positive for Pakistan to help overcome its energy challenges,\u201d reasoned Shahab.  He said that over the last 12 years of its operations, the EPQL plant has operated with a very high capacity/ availability factor and is an ideal candidate for this gas allocation. \u201cThe EPQL plant is specifically designed for consumption of low BTU gas with high Sulphur; therefore, it can prudently utilize the Kandhkot gas field to produce cheaper electricity,\u201d said Shahab.

These include Fauji group, Fatima group and Engro Corporation. Fauji Fertilizer Company Limited is Pakistan's largest urea manufacturing company. Fauji Fertilizer Company was a joint venture between Fauji Foundation and Haldor Topsoe A/S of Denmark. It was incorporated in 1978, as a private limited company, with its first urea plant commissioning in 1982 having an annual capacity of 570,000 tons. Its subsidiaries are FFC Energy Limited and Fauji Fresh n Freeze Limited, and the associated companies include Fauji Fertilizer Bin Qasim Limited, Askari Bank Limited, Fauji Cement Company Limited, Thar Energy Limited and Pakistan Maroc Phosphore S.A., Morocco. The company now operates three world scale urea plants, located in Rahim Yar Khan and Ghotki, having an aggregate capacity of over 2 million tons per annum. The company holds 49.88 percent stake in Fauji Fertilizer Bin Qasim Limited (FFBL), which is the country's only granular urea and DAP manufacturing complex located at Port Qasim, Karachi. FFC has a well-mapped marketing network across Pakistan, where it markets its flagship Sona Urea along with imported urea, and also markets products other fertilizers such as SOP, DAP and MOP. The company has consistently been placed in the Karachi Stock Exchange Top 25 Companies for over 20 years. Globally, FFC is a well-recognized member of the International Fertilizer Industry Association (IFA), Arab Fertilizer Association (AFA), and the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), USA. The pattern of shareholding table suggests that the highest number of shares is held by sponsors. Pakistan's agriculture sector posted a strong performance in FY18, depicting multiyear high growth of 3.8 percent. The year saw improved crop yields, greeter access to finance and higher crop prices, that resulted in improved farm economy and better fertilizer off-take, with more balanced application. Despite all these factors, the industry urea off-take failed to grow in CY18, at 5.81 million tons, almost flat at yesteryear's levels. Feedstock gas prices were increased across the board in 2018, which led to increased pressure on cost, part of which had to be passed on to the consumers. The urea subsidy scheme also faced discontinuation in 2018, which had its impact on market sentiments. The urea prices, on an average increased by 16 percent during the year, to average at Rs 1576 per bag, up from Rs 1357 per bag in 2017. On the other hand, DAP off-take also witnessed a decline of 6 percent year-on-year, at 2.23 million tons. DAP prices during 2018 saw a massive 25 percent increase in average prices year-on-year to Rs3276 per bag. The year 2018 started off with DAP prices at Rs 2891 per bag, and ended with Rs3670 per bag. The cumulative urea and DAP spending in 2018 crossed Rs300 billion, the highest in three years. International urea prices have stayed range bound of late around $270-$290 per ton, which gives cushion to the local manufactures in terms of pricing power. Urea subsidy has been announced in the mini budget and should support the off-take in the peak buying season. That said, the delay in sowing of crops, may affect the overall demand, and the industry urea off-take is not expected to cross the magical figure of 6 million tons in 2019 either. In overall terms, Pakistan's urea to DAP ratio has improved significantly from previous years, both in terms of spending and application. But there is still a long way to go to reach the ideal application ratio of 2:1. Strictly talking about Rabi season only, the ratio has once again worsened from as low as 1.55 in CY16 to 2.13 today - at a four year high. With better rains this season and significantly cheaper electricity for tube well purposes, one expects the farmers' economy to improve in the months to come FFC continued the legacy of excellent capacity utilization levels of all its three urea plants, amassing the second highest ever production of 2.52 million tons in 2018. The sales at 2.52 million tons were lower by 6 percent year-on-year due to lower product availability, mainly because of minimal inventory carried over from last year. The combined market share improved by 1 percentage point to 53 percent during 2018, reiterating the strong brand positioning. In terms of revenues, the company recorded its highest ever top line, as the sales crossed Rs 100 billion for the very first item in the company's rich history. The revenues for 2018 increased by a massive 17 percent year-on-year, continuing the sales growth trend that started many years ago. The revenue from imported fertilizer sales improved by 27 percent year-on-year as prices improved significantly during the year. After two difficult years in 2016 and 2017, the pricing power was back with the industry, and despite lower volumetric sales, FFC managed to grow its top line based on increased selling price. The company managed to improve the gross profit ratio to 26.4 percent in 2018 - from the depths of 19 percent in 2017. Effective cost control was at the core of FFC's ability to post significantly improved gross margins, despite a massive depreciation in rupee value and significantly increased cost of feedstock gas. Despite reduced volume of imported urea sales, the sharp rupee depreciation escalated the cost of sales by a massive 26 percent from last year. The ability to post such impressive gross margins in tough operating environment is testament to FFC's operational and marketing strengths. FFC's investment portfolio yielded good returns during the year, as the investment income grew by a mammoth 86 percent year-on-year to Rs 2.64 billion, at the back of gains on foreign currency and effective treasury management. The dividend income on the other hand went down by 45 percent year-on-year, owing to reduced payout from the associated companies. The cost of sales had increased massively in 2014, as Gas Infrastructure Development Cess was imposed. The gross margin declined in CY16 and CY17 as the market conditions remained depressed due to a variety of factors. Furthermore, the government's intervention in fertilizer pricing in 2016 and 2017 was at its peak, which had a telling impact on gross margins. Ever since, reduced international urea prices gave back the pricing control to the local industry, hence the improved margins in CY18. The year 2019 has begun on a promising note for FFC, with production and off take of the flagship Sona urea staying flattish over the year. Urea off-take at a little over 0.5 million tons during the quarter, coupled with considerably improved selling price for urea, helped FFC register a massive 26 percent year-on-year growth in Sona urea revenue. The overall revenue dipped by a meager 1 percent year-on-year, mainly on account of lower DAP sales. The gross margins were considerably improved from the same period last year, as the company enjoyed better pricing power and control over previous year. That said, the overall operating environment resulted in higher finance and other expenses, owing to higher interest rates, inflation and energy prices. This was more than offset by exceptional contribution from other income, particularly from the treasury arm, contributing to nearly Rs 1 billion to other income, which was also supplemented by decent dividend income contribution. FFC has continued expanding its wings with continuous diversification in the business. The company has invested Rs 1.46 billion with 30 percent equity in the in coal energy project in collaboration with HUBCO and CMEC. On the fertilizer front, things are expected to be tough in terms of urea demand, as there have been reports of delayed sowing of major crops. The expected subsidy in CY19 might prove handy down the year. Farmers' economy should improve going forward given reduced tube well energy prices, and improved access to credit. FFC will be banking on its strengths in the core business and associated companies to further supplement the bottom line growth.

That was one of the subjects of discussion at a recent roundtable jointly organised by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) and Institute of Business Administration (IBA). On the whole, the proposed solutions revolved around the role of government to set fair policies and regulation, leaving production activities in agriculture, manufacturing and services to the private sector, as was argued by IBA\u2019s Executive Director, Dr. Farrukh Iqbal. Others demanded the government to actively engage the private sector; for example, by virtue of giving private sector the leadership of organisations like Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP) and Small and Medium Enterprise Development Authority (SMEDA). Without attempting to give an exhaustive list of suggestions to Sindh government and to the National Network of Economic Think Tanks of which the SDPI and the IBA are part of, BR Research offers the following specific proposals. Reforms, whether taxation related (such as GST on services) or whether in terms of sectoral policies and regulations cannot bear full crop of fruits without a solid understanding of Sindh\u2019s economy. To achieve that understanding, it is paramount that Sindh invests in district-wise social and economic database. One cannot help recall the lament of late Tashfeen Khalid, former chairman Sindh Revenue Board, about the lack of data of service sector establishments in Sindh. In a recent interview with BR Research, Shabbar Zaidi, Chairman A.F. Ferguson & Co, also echoed similar sentiments when he pointed out to the state\u2019s ignorance of the number of shops and hotels in Karachi\u2019s Saddar area. Filling such information gap is critical for Sindh\u2019s success. Another fundamental reform that Sindh has to work on is proper market-based valuation at the time of recording of urban property transactions within the province. The most recent State of Economy report by the central bank shows that plots in Karachi gave a return of 129 percent during 2013-2018 whereas KSE-100 gave return of 100 percent and equity funds 131 percent. Plots in Lahore yielded a return of about 55 percent during the same period. The point being that investments in plots and real estate in Sindh is a classic dead capital that is giving unfair competition to investments in productive sectors. Assuming that most people want to invest in the province they live in, when the recording of urban property transactions at market value will substantially reduce real estate speculation, the move will eventually channel a decent size of real estate sector savings (whether earned through ill-gotten means or not) to more productive sectors within the province of Sindh. The move may also slow the speculative growth in price of industrial land, which unnecessary inflates the capex for industrial projects, although other measures also need to be taken to ensure that cost of industrial land doesn\u2019t go out of proportion. In terms of economic sectors Sindh has a host of options to work with. These include farming value added, livestock, the sea economy, housing sector and labour exports. While there is no doubt about the potential of livestock sector, in terms of exports it is a 10 to 15-year dream given high prevalence of foot and mouth disease in Pakistan\u2019s livestock sector, amongst other problems. Instead, the development of sea economy offers more potential. Pakistan\u2019s sea economy hasn\u2019t been a big sector ever, save for the presence of some shipping giants before nationalisation. A myriad of reasons account for that, details of which have been discussed before (See BR Research \u2018 ?\u2019 August 27, 2018). But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that sea economy \u2013 from sea sports to sea food \u2013 cannot be kick started. Given the service sector nature in the case of former, and shorter lifecycle in the case of former, sea economy offers quicker realisation of potential. Housing of course is a nationwide issue; Sindh doesn\u2019t have a monopoly on that problem. But in the long run, possible production of fly ash cement from the coal-fired power plants (e.g. by Hubco or mine-mouth power plants in Thar) can potentially offer great dividends to Sindh, by way of being closer to the production centres. Initial channel checks suggest that fly ash cement is currently cheaper than ordinary portland cement and also used in much less quantities than the OPC. But that has to be explored in detail! Lastly, Sindh\u2019s ratio in labour exports is poor. According to Economic Survey FY18, Sindh\u2019s share in overseas workers was about 10 percent, whereas the province\u2019s share in total population is around 25 percent. Sindh\u2019s economic managers need to address this gap; not through quotas but by strengthening the market of vocational training and labour exports. Since devolution, Pakistan\u2019s future economic growth rests in greater part with the provinces. In light of this, and the just-started negotiations on inter-governmental fiscal transfers, the National Network of Economic Think Tanks needs to explore how the federal government can incentivise provincial government to foster economic activity in the sectors that lie squarely in provincial domain.

It owns an RFO-fired power station of 1,200 MW in Balochistan, at Hub, which is its base plant. It also owns a 214 MW combined cycle RFO-fired power station in Narowal, Punjab, and also holds 75 percent controlling interest in Laraib Energy Limited, which owns and operates a run-off-the-river hydel power plant near Mangla Dam in AJK.  HUBC in the last 5 years has ventured into the coal business and established wholly owned subsidiaries to launch new initiatives amid shifting fuel preference for power generation from FO to coal and LNG. It owns 46 percent shares of newly commissioned 1320MW imported coal-based China Power Hub Generation Company (Private) Limited (CPHGC) at Hub. The company is the only power producer in Pakistan with four projects listed in the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) including CPHGC, Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company (SECMC) and the upcoming Thar Energy Limited (TEL) and ThalNova Power Thar (Pvt.) Ltd. (TNPTL) at Thar Block II. The power generation capacity oh HUBC will enhance to over 3500MW after completion of these power projects. Key shareholding has changed several times for HUBC. Dawood Hercules was a major shareholder of HUBC since 2012 when the IPP\u2019s initial sponsors Xenel International and National Power International exited from their shareholdings and Dawood Hercules Corporation and its affiliates bought most of this given up shareholding. Then in 2018, Mega Conglomerate acquired a substantial shareholding in Hub Power Company from Dawood Hercules and Cyan Limited to become the largest shareholder of the company. According to company\u2019s website, Mega Conglomerate is a diversified conglomerate with business holdings including the country\u2019s largest container terminal, third largest dairy producer, top tier cement manufacturing company, vertically integrated shipping company and a progressive real-estate developer. Mega Conglomerate owned approximately 17 percent shareholding in HUBC according to FY20 annual accounts.  FY15 was a year of transformation and growth for Hubco. The company generated one of the highest returns for the shareholders, revamped and turned around the base business. The slight decrease in load factors came from a decrease in generation, caused by maintenance work on the boilers. The company\u2019s consolidated earnings increased by around 48 percent year-on-year in FY15 In FY16, the company\u2019s consolidated earnings increased by around 7.5 percent year-on-year, which was affected by the decline in turnover in FY16. Revenues toppled by 34 percent year-on-year due to lower furnace oil prices, lower generation bonus and lower Net Electrical Output (NEO) due to low load demanded by NTDC The IPP\u2019s consolidated earnings in FY17 came down significantly. The decrease in consolidated earnings as reported in the company\u2019s annual accounts, was mainly due to higher repair and maintenance expenditure on the Hub Plant and 36,000 running hours\u2019 major maintenance of six engines at Narowal Plant, lower exchange rate and higher losses of TEL and CPHGC projects that had been initiated. Apart from that, higher general and administrative expenses and lower other income also affected the bottomline in FY17 that fell by 9.2 percent year-on-year.  HUBC\u2019s posted slight improvement in earnings for FY18 despite a slight dip in revenues. The consolidated earnings grew by three percent year-on-year in FY18. The modest growth in earnings was driven by lower repair and maintenance expenditure at Hub and Narowal Plants. However, these were partially offset by lower profits of Laraib, higher financing costs and administrative expenses. In FY18, HUBC\u2019s base plant at Hub witnessed a drop in load factors from 65 percent to 49.5 percent due to lower electricity demand from the power purchaser. The Narowal plant also witnessed a decrease in load factors from 71 percent to 64 percent in FY18, which was due to the overhaul of three engines and seven alternators at Narowal plant.  During FY19, the country\u2019s power generation from furnace oil declined by 60 percent year-on-year, where its share in total power generation was only 7 percent in FY19 versus19 percent in FY18. As a result, HUBC\u2019s load factors for its base plant plunged from 49 percent to just at 7.87 percent due to no generation on FO. Revenues were seen shrinking by 42 percent year-on-year due to lower electricity dispatches. Lower generation resulted in lower operating costs. However, the company\u2019s bottomline posted a flattish growth of only 2 percent year-on-year, and apart from slow growth in revenues, the restriction in earnings came from higher finance cost due to higher interest rates and higher capital expenditure largely coming from coal investments. The IPP also did not announce any dividend during the year.  Moreover, the cash it received from the first Energy Suck was used to pay off PSO\u2019s payables. FY20 has been a turbulent year for the power sector not only because of the COVID-19 pandemic overtaking the second half of the year, but also the investigation in the IPPs\u2019 returns that landed IPPs in hot waters. In terms of financial performance, FY20 for HUBC has primarily been about milking its coal investments. At a time when thermal power generation has been dwindling in the country due to depleting natural gas and controls on furnace oil consumption, HUBC\u2019s associated company - China Power Hub Generation Company commenced generation in August 2019.  HUBC posted consolidated earnings growth of over 2.2 times for FY20 despite a17 percent year-on-year decline in the turnover. This was because around 50 percent of the growth in the bottomline was brought by the earnings from the 1320MW coal fired power plant, while the company\u2019s base plant at Hub continued to face falling load factors. The FO based plants received lesser load factors due to low demand from the Power Purchaser due to lockdown in the country as well as availability of relative electricity on coal and hydel.  Another factor that fueled earnings growth was currency depreciation that stood at around 24 percent in FY20.  The growth in earnings in FY20 for HUBC was held back by 61 percent higher finance cost; higher effective tax rate for FY20 versus FY19, which was due to the recognition of deferred tax on share of profit from CPHGC; and one-off loss due to transfer of 3 percent equity shareholding in CPHGC by Hub Power Holding Company and China Power International (Pakistan) Investment Limited (CPIPI) to Government of Balochistan. However, the delay in payments and looming circular debt constrained the company\u2019s cash flows, which resulted in no dividend announcement.  And amid the uncertainties over termination of contracts of the IPPs as a result of the recent \nagreement between IPPs and the government, HUBC coal investments hold the key for the company; the company might be converting the furnace oil plants to coal or RLNG ones. And besides the imported coal plant commissioning in FY20, the indigenous coal project Thar Energy Limited (TEL) also achieved the financial close. The second plant in Thar, 330MW ThalNova Power Thar (Pvt.) Ltd (TNTPL) Project also signed financing agreement in July 2019; construction work on both projects is going on albeit at a slower pace due to covid-19 outbreak.

It also owns a 214 MW combined cycle RFO-fired power station in Narowal, Punjab, and also holds 75 percent controlling interest in Laraib Energy Limited, which owns and operates a run-off-the-river hydel power plant near Mangla Dam in AJK. \nAgainst the backdrop of shift in the fuel for power generation from FO to coal and LNG, HUBC ventured into the coal business and established wholly owned subsidiaries to launch new initiatives. HUBC owns 47.5 percent shares of newly commissioned 1320MW imported coal based China Power Hub Generation Company (Private) Limited (CPHGC) at Hub. The company is the only power producer in Pakistan with four projects listed in the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) including CPHGC, Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company (SECMC) and the upcoming Thar Energy Limited (TEL) and ThalNova Power Thar (Pvt.) Ltd. (TNPTL) at Thar Block II. The power generation capacity oh HUBC will enhance to over 3580MW after completion of these power projects. \nHUBC's share ownership has changed hands several times. Dawood Hercules was a major shareholder of HUBC since 2012 when the IPP's initial sponsors Xenel International and National Power International exited from their shareholdings and Dawood Hercules Corporation and its affiliates bought most of this given up shareholding. Then in 2018, Mega Conglomerate acquired a substantial shareholding in Hub Power Company from Dawood Hercules and Cyan Limited to become the largest shareholder of the company. \nAccording to company's website, Mega Conglomerate is a diversified conglomerate with business holdings including the country's largest container terminal, third largest dairy producer, top tier cement manufacturing company, vertically integrated shipping company and a progressive real-estate developer. By the end of FY19, Mega Conglomerate owned approximately 20 percent shareholding in HUBC according to annual accounts. The breakup of the shareholding is shown in the illustration. InFY15, Hub's base plant maintained an uninterrupted power supply to the national grid, whereas the slight decrease in load factors came from a decrease in generation, caused by maintenance work on the boilers. The Narowal plant too witnessed a decrease in load factor in the fiscal year due to restriction imposed by the National Power Control Center. Its hydel power plant, Laraib had a higher capacity utilisation in FY15 due to better hydrology received from Mangla Power Plant and significant reduction in the number of annual maintenance days. \nIn FY16, the Hub plant's load factors improved as electricity generation during the year was higher due to higher availability and utilisation by the power purchaser. Growth plans and revamping activity in the last year or so affected earning that improved a bit in FY16 when the power company decided to outsource O&M services to Hub Power Services. However, the consolidated earnings in FY17 came down significantly. The decrease in consolidated earnings as reported in the company's annual accounts was mainly due to higher repair and maintenance expenditure on the Hub Plant and 36,000 running hours' major maintenance of six engines at Narowal Plant, lower exchange rate and higher losses of TEL and CPHGC projects that had been initiated. Apart from that, higher general and administrative expenses and lower other income also affected the bottom-line in FY17 that fell by 9.2 percent year-on-year. \nHUBC's posted slight improvement in earnings for FY18 despite a slight dip in revenues. The consolidated earnings grew by three percent year-on-year in FY18. The modest growth in earnings was driven by lower repair and maintenance expenditure at Hub and Narowal Plants. \nHowever, these were partially offset by lower profits of Laraib, higher financing costs and administrative expenses. In FY18, HUBC's base plant at Hub witnessed a drop in load factors from 65 percent to 49.5 percent due to lower electricity demand from the power purchaser. The Narowal plant also witnessed a decrease in load factors from 71 percent to 64 percent in FY18, which was due to the overhaul of three engines and seven alternators at Narowal plant. During FY19, the country's power generation from furnace oil declined by 60 percent year-on-year, where its share in total power generation was only 7 percent in FY19 versus19 percent in FY18. As a result, IPPs that run on fuel oil witnessed a further decline in the load factors. HUBC's load factors for its base plant plunged from 49 percent to just at 7.87 percent due to no generation on FO. As a result, HUBC's revenues were seen shrinking by 42 percent year-on-year due to lower electricity dispatches to the power purchaser despite significant currency depreciation that lifts the price component of the revenues. While its base plant at Hub operated at about only 7.87 percent of its capacity, the load factors for its other plant at Narowal and Laraib (hydel) were also lower. \nLower generation resulted in lower operating costs and hence HUBC saw an 18 percent year-on-year improvement in its gross profits, and hence gross margins doubled due to lower base/denominator. However, the company's bottom-line posted a flattish growth of only 2 percent year-on-year, and apart from slow growth in revenues, the restriction in earnings came from higher finance cost due to higher interest rates and higher capital expenditure largely coming from coal investments. This was also the reason why it has been skipping dividend announcements. Moreover, the cash it received from the first Energy Suck was used to pay off PSO's payables. HUBC continued to witness a decline in its consolidated revenues, which was due to lower power generation at its base plant at Hub. Lower load factor of the main plant at Hub also meant lower operating costs, which along with currency depreciation was the main factor behind better gross profit in 1QFY20. \nThe company's consolidated earnings growth was also assisted by the share of profits from China Power Hub Generation Company that commissioned the 2x660MW coal power plants in August. HUBC's consolidated earnings were impacted by twice the increase in finance cost due to the increase in financing the capex. The company is banking on its coal investments to reverse the trend of falling revenues. HUBC in the 1QFY20 made the adjustment particularly to address the FO crisis by uplifting the company's equity from 26 percent to 47.5 percent in CPHGC through rights issue in FY19 and achieved COD first quarter 2020 creating, thus creating a new stream for revenues. \nIt also took management control by taking 38.3 percent of ThalNova, which is a project identical to TharEnergy. This not only led to cost optimisation, but also creates an opportunity for HUBC to expand revenue base with several inter-aligned services on both these coal projects in Thar. HUBC's lignite based 330MW Thar Energy Limited Project in Thar Block II has completed 37 percent of construction and is targeting to achieve COD by the end of March 2021.

The power company\u2019s earnings have been growing where the share of profits from associates has been key in the growth witnessed in its bottomline.  The dividend from diversification started paying off in FY20 when HUBC\u2019s associated company - China Power Hub Generation Company commenced generation in August 2019. The start of electricity generation from the 1320MW coal plant could not have commenced at a better time when thermal power generation has been dwindling in the country due to depleting natural gas as well as shift from furnace oil based generation to coal and hydel.  HUBC\u2019s consolidated turnover in 1QFY21 was up by 12 percent year-on-year, which was primarily due to increase in generation from HUBC\u2019s subsidiary \u2013 Narowal Plant. Load factor of the base plant at Hub was almost nil during 1QFY21 for reasons mentioned above. However, the rise in dispatches from Narowal in particular along with higher prices lifted the topline. Though the company\u2019s gross profits increased, gross margins took a hit due to increased utilization and hence greater cost of sales.  Besides the topline growth, HUBC\u2019s bottomline benefitted from a 38 percent year-on- year decline in finance cost as well as 86 percent higher profits from associated companies. The decline in finance cost was due to lower interest rates, while the higher share of profits from associates came from China Power Hub Generation Company. The share of profits from associated stood at a staggering 22 percent in 1QFY21 versus 13 percent in 1QFY20. HUBC\u2019s earnings for 1QFY21 rose by 45 percent year-on-year, which continued to follow the trend of FY20 where the company; 50 percent of the growth in the bottomline in FY20 was brought by the earnings from CPHGC. What is better in FY21 so far is the decline in finance cost as well as the growth in the topline. Also, what took many by surprise was the announcement of an interim cash dividend of Rs4 per share after no dividend announced for two years due to capital expenditure undertaken in coal power generation as well as liquidity issues from the rising circular debt.

The International Energy Association (IEA) in its latest Energy Mix issue: Coal 2020 has spelled out recent global and regional trends in coal demand, supply and trade, and an outlook to 2025, which reflects the unprecedented times of 2020.  Decline in coal demand in 2019 was due to weak electricity demand growth and low natural gas prices. The IEA Report shows that global coal demand decreased 1.8 percent after two years of growth in 2019 where power generation from coal declined by 3 percent \u2013 as electricity from renewables picked up. After an electricity-driven decline in coal demand in 2019, 2020 followed with a pandemic-driven drop. Decline in overall demand for electricity during 2020 was highlighted by lockdowns and weak economic activities - compounded by low natural gas prices. The report predicts that in 2020 global coal demand will experience its largest drop since the Second World War, falling 5 percent from 2019 levels. Note that global coal demand is largely driven by electricity and power demand, which started shifting towards renewables in 2019, a trend that is likely to continue and build in 2021 and beyond.  However, the forecasted recovery in coal consumption in 2021 does not come as a surprise. As the world recovers from the yearlong implications of COVID-19, electricity demand and industrial activity will increase \u2013 the two areas where coal consumption dominates. It is also likely that climate-related goals and targets might be held back to bring back economic growth. IEA forecasts a rebound in global coal demand of 2.6 percent, led by China, India, and Southeast Asia; even the decline of coal use in the US and the EU is likely to slow down as they might see their coal consumption increase for the first time in 10 years.  Coal surely holds a position in the near future but only for a little while till the economies come out of the pandemic-hit world and resume their climate and emission targets. Overall, coal demand is expected to plateau beyond 2025 due to three plausible reasons. One, coal-fired power plant retirements in developed countries will accelerate. Two, the renewables will gain foothold, dimming coal\u2019s prospects in power generation. And three, coal is no more the cheapest source of energy; oil prices crashed to their lowest ever during the pandemic and gas prices were also driven low.   The report categorizes Pakistan among countries that will however continue to see a rise in coal consumption. contrary to Bangladesh where coal demand is likely to be rising much slowly, coal demand and consumption in Pakistan. Coal power plants already up and running that include the 1,320 MW Sahiwal plant in Punjab; 1,320 MW Port Qasim plant in Sindh; and 1,320 MW Hubco plant in Balochistan as part of CPEC \u2013 all using imported coal. And though the Prime Minister has recently announced a rollback on coal powered generation plants going forward, another 5 GW of coal-fired power plants are planned beyond 2021, mostly operating on domestic lignite as per IEA\u2019s data.

Hubco, which is in financial trouble after the resignation of its CEO Khalid Mansoor (now appointed as SAPM on CPEC), recently terminated services of a number employees in addition to slashing salaries of senior technical people working on the plant.   Pakistan State Oil (PSO) has also written several letters to the government, seeking help to get billions of rupees due \"receivables against supply of oil to Hubco power plant\" in recent months. The last letter was written on August 11, 2021 for payment of RFO supplies during July-August 2021. In the third quarter of FY 2020- 21, the government approved an amount of Rs 57.981 billion for Hubco in accordance with a renegotiated deal of which 40 per cent was paid on June 4, 2021. However, the government has deduced Rs 11 billion against fuel supplied to Hubco plant for first fill of plant after two decades with the help of an influential institution which facilitated the deal. However, the government has put on ice a proposal of SAPM on Power and Petroleum Tabish Gauhar regarding purchase of plant to terminate it.   According to the concept paper of Tabish Gauhar, Hubco (1200MW) is an almost-idle IPP asset in South Balochistan with around 1% dispatch factor. Its PPA is expiring in 2027.   According to him, even with the recently negotiated (MoU) tariff decrease, GoP has to pay almost Rs260 billion to Hubco in take-or-pay capacity charges until 2027 (without almost no need for their power now or envisaged) which adds to the overall power sector's cost of generation and circular debt. He maintained that one possible option for resolving this issue is an early buy-out / termination of Hubco which is also envisaged under their contract and for the GOP to take over this oil-fired power plant. The payable upfront amount is calculated to be roughly Rs. 65 billion. However, there would be little to no use for GoP of this oil-fired plant that ranks very low on the economic / dispatch merit order. An alternative option is that GoP agrees to pay Rs. 65 billion to Hubco in lieu of Rs. 260 billion if this money is explicitly earmarked / ring fenced by Hubco for: (i) financing the conversion of 600 MW of their oil-fired units to Thar Coal and selling that power to K-Electric under a private-to- private PPA with no GoP involvement. That will also reduce, albeit partially, GoP's liability / responsibility toward continued support for KE's growing future power needs; and (ii) financing the conversion of their remaining 300-600MW power units to produce up to 300 million gallons per day of desalinated water for supply to Karachi under a Water Purchase Agreement with GoP & GoS on mutually agreed terms & conditions (including any \"at-source\" deduction between GoP & GoS for the water charges). A preliminary pre-feasibility study (including costing) has been done by Hubco on this. Tabish Gauhar claims that both the proposed initiatives may be financed under the Karachi Transformation Plan. Another advantage of this proposal for GoP is the potential release of a $12.5 million annual payment liability toward Asia Petroleum Limited (APL) pipeline (that was set up to supply furnace oil to Hubco but is now lying idle) and passing that on to a neighboring oil refinery for their future usage to reverse pump their diesel and petrol products across Pakistan in lieu of the current practice of tank lorries / road transportation. He further noted that transportation of incremental Thar Coal to Hubco (and also Jamshoro, Lucky Power, etc.) via the Thar Rail Link proposal should be an integral part of the Pakistan Railways' revival plan and would also help in reducing the overall cost per ton of Thar coal (due to economies of scale) for the overall benefit of Pakistan's power sector (lower tariff, circular debt, etc.).

The Implementation Committee submitted payment mechanism in its report. The CCoE and Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) considered the report and approved the payment mechanism\u2019 to IPPs, in meetings held on February 8, 2021 which was ratified by the Cabinet on February 9, 2021.

According to the proposal approved by the ECC on May 6, 2021 and ratified by the Federal Cabinet in its meeting held on May 18, 2021, the government had pledged to pay 40 per cent of agreed amount as first installment to 35 IPPs. The sources said, minutes of the Federal Cabinet have been received by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) and Ministry of Finance and paper work is being completed to pay due amounts of 35 IPPs. According to an official statement, Finance Ministry says that in compliance with the directives of the Prime Minister and under guidance of the Finance Minister, the government has completed the first payment transaction of 40% to 20 IPPs amounting to Rs 89.2 billion equally divided in cash 5 years\u2019 Sukuk and 10 years\u2019 PIBs. Finance Division has completed this transaction in coordination with relevant organisations/departments including State Bank of Pakistan and Power Division. The government had assured the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that payments of Rs 180 billion will be made to 47 IPPs as first installment before May 31, 2021 but this was delayed due to ongoing investigation against 12 IPPs of the 2002 policy. It subsequently delayed the final approval of the Cabinet. The government has to pay a cumulative amount of Rs 403 billion to 47 IPPs by December 2021. As per the agreement, the government had to pay agreed amounts to the IPPs by March 29, 2021. The first installment of 40 per cent is duly divided into cash, PIBs and Sukuk and would be adjusted against power sector subsidy claims for the FY 2019-20 and 2020-21. Similarly, disbursement of the remaining 60 per cent will be taken care of in the next financial year.  Power Division has sought a Rs 90 billion supplementary grant to pay 40 percent agreed amount to IPPs established under the Generation Policy 1994 and the Generation Policy pre-1994. The ECC has constituted a committee on this proposal so that a permanent mechanism is devised to ensure payment to the IPPs as per the agreements. Power Division has also proposed that payments to all IPPs under the Power Policy 2002, which have signed agreements pursuant to MoUs may be withheld till the conclusion of NAB investigation and suspend the process of signing ASA with IPPs under the 2002 Power Policy, and notification of their revised tariff as determined by Nepra till the conclusion of the NAB investigation.

Of the total, the PSO has to receive Rs194.283 billion from the power sector on account of oil supply for power generation. Generation companies are major defaulters that have to pay Rs140.714 billion.  Hubco owes Rs45.105 billion, whereas, Kapco has to pay Rs8.465 billion. The PSO has also played a pivotal role in the LNG sector.  The company entered into another agreement with Qatar Petroleum under G2G arrangement to supply an additional three million tons of LNG for a period of 10 years. This contract shall add additional volumes to an already executed 15-year long-term sales purchase agreement (SPA), making the PSO the largest supplier of LNG in the country with a supply base of 6.75 million tons per annum. However, the company is facing circular debt issue in this sector.  It is supplying LNG to the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) to distribute to the consumers. The SNGPL has to pay Rs164.759 billion to the PSO on account of LNG supply.  This is a new addition in the circular debt chain in the oil and gas sectors. The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) is another big defaulter of PSO. The PSO supplies jet fuel to the airline to continue its operations.  However, it has not been able to pay dues to PSO on account of fuel supply. The PIA has to pay Rs21.974 billion to the PSO.  The state-run oil company is due to receive Rs10.161 billion from the government on account of price differential claims. Despite multibillion rupees of the PSO being stuck due to non-payment of dues by its clients, it has been making major payments to oil refineries in Pakistan. The PSO has to pay Rs32.101 billion to oil refineries.  It owes Rs16.836 billion to Pak-Arab Refinery Company (Parco), Rs4.931 billion to Pakistan Refinery Limited (PRL), Rs3.984 billion to National Refinery Limited (NRL), Rs3.848 billion to Attock Refinery Limited (ARL), Rs1.100 billion to Byco, and Rs1.403 billion Enar. The PSO is also the largest importer of oil.  It has an agreement with Kuwait Petroleum.  It has to pay the company Rs129 billion on account of LC payments for oil and LNG. The financial results have demonstrated the PSO\u2019s agility and strength across its diverse portfolio despite, the challenging economic scenario and recurrent waves of the pandemic. The PSO is leading the market by a large margin, delivering a phenomenal performance over and above the industry average. Despite swelling outstanding, the company has exhibited an outstanding growth of 21.9 percent in liquid fuels over last year with volumes reaching 9.2 million tons, attaining a market share of 46.3 percent in financial year 2021 compared to 44.3 percent in financial year 2020-21. The PSO also achieved its highest-ever volume of 7.6 million tons in the white oil segment despite, the shrinking jet fuel and kerosene oil industry, with a market share of 45.2 percent in financial year 2021 compared to 44 percent in financial year 2020.

Sources said Tabish Gauhar is on the defensive these days, especially after his negative remarks about the CPEC projects in Karachi, which led to a rebuttal from National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in that NAB would seek a clarification from him after seeing the video of his address at Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) head office, Karachi. Tabish Gauhar left for Dubai from Karachi after his address at FPCCI where he spent a few days but has returned since.  An insider told Business Recorder that he was on leave for a few days and went to see his family in the emirate as he had not visited them on Eidul Fitr.      Another official claimed that Tabish Gauhar is no longer the main decision-maker after Minister for Energy Hammad Azhar began to take decisions.

(x) Is SEQUOIA taken as alternate or bridging ship what are the protocols and procedures of commissioning an alternate ship and if, for some reasons it is not sailing back and replaced by dry docked ship Exquisite how much time is needed to perform requisite inspections, what will be arrangements to check any other pause in supply chain of LNG? (xi) What is the chain of correspondence from terminals to MoE? (xii) Is there any provision of increasing output of focal gas fields and has it ever happened in the past? (xiii) Who manages and operates gas fields Kunner Pysaki and Qadir Pur? (xiv) Who does contingency planning of LNG/RFO/LSFO and when were all fuels calculated? Who supervised that?  When was last coordination meeting of fuel calculations held and who chaired it? Were fuel stocks at Kapco, Muzaffargarh, Jamshoro and Hubco complete for summer peak season (June, July)?

According to the power company, the circular debt situation has continued to worsen as huge receivables have accumulated on the books of Hubco and other lPPs. This is happening even after steps have been taken to settle circular debt through settlements under the PPA amendment agreements signed with many IPPs, wherein outstanding balances have been partially settled through payments in instalments. However, a lot more still needs to be done to resolve the issue of circular debt.  \u201cIt is believed that the complete resolution of circular debt will take some years depending upon the government\u2019s course of actions,\u201d added Kamran Kamal.  \u201cIFRS-9 requires us to recognise a loss for the overdue receivables due mainly because of their ageing. Hubco\u2019s overdue amounts from CPPA(G) are not by its own choice but is the direct result of circular debt. The application of the impairment model provided in IFRS-9 will result in huge impairment losses on these late overdue amounts resulting in significant dilution of profitability and erosion of our retained earnings.  \u201cTherefore, the company has requested Power Division to recommend to SECP for a permanent exemption from the application of IFRS-9 on the trade debts on the same grounds as were applicable previously, some of which are as follows: (i) the application of IFRS-9 will increase the variability of IPPs results from one period to another due to the abnormal payment pattern being followed by the Government of Pakistan. This volatility in results from one period to another may give misleading results to the users of the financial statements.   \u201cFurthermore, as there is no firm timeline from CPPA-G for settlement of these receivables, it would be very difficult to estimate the loss. Also, different assumptions by different companies and auditors will significantly affect the comparability of numbers between different companies; (ii) impairment on government-guaranteed receivable will deteriorate the credibility of the GoP (Government of Pakistan).   \u201cThis will send a negative image of GoP to domestic and international investors and can hamper future foreign direct investments;(iii) large impairment losses due to the application or IFRS-9 will deteriorate the already declining capital markets of the country as a result of panic amongst the shareholders of these lPPs; (iv) the impairment loss will also adversely impact the lenders\u2019 covenants and may result in breach of loan covenants.  \u201cThis will also negatively impact the ability of IPPs to borrow money in these times of financial crunch; (v) application of lFRS-9 will restrict the ability of lPPs to declare dividends to their shareholders. IPPs are already severely suffering from the circular debt issue and will face additional negative financial impacts of impairment losses on their receivables which will hamper their ability to pay dividends to their shareholders as the impairment losses recognised will lower their available profits for distribution,\u201d the letter states.  M/s Hubco maintained that keeping in view the prevailing circumstances, the ministry should facilitate in obtaining a permanent exemption for all lPPs facing circular debt issue from the application of lFRS-9 by recommending to the SECP for issuing a requisite notification under the powers provided in Section 225(3) of the Companies Act, 2017.

The foregoing shall be subject to the second paragraph of the clause 5.3 and to paragraph 8 of part XII of schedule 2. Whereas serial number 2-part VI of the second schedule to the IA requires issuance of the statutory notifications giving effect to the provisions of clause 18 for a period of at least the term of this agreement.\u201d Kamran Kamal, in his letter further stated that clause 2 of the IA covers the issue of \u201ccommencement and duration\u201d provided clause 3.2 shall continue in full force and effect unless or until it is terminated pursuant to the provisions of the agreement.

He referred to Hubco\u2019s letters dated May 18, 2022 and June 10, 2022 wherein the company had highlighted the disparity in payments to it and subsequent meetings with Secretary Power and CPPA-G officials, where the company was assured that the issue of disparity would be addressed in Q1 CFY 2022-23.  According to the CEO Hubco, some additional payments were subsequently made to the company, and currently Hubco\u2019s invoices are seven months overdue, which is significantly higher than other similar IPPs. The power company has claimed that its total overdue receivables stood at Rs 52.6 billion, of which the volume of Capacity Purchase Price (CPP) was Rs 16.652 billion, Energy Purchase Price (EPP) Rs 19.104 billion, and Late Payment Interest (LPI), Rs 16.133 billion.  Hubco is already facing significant liquidity challenges due to its increasing overdue receivables and additional cash flow requirement for its expansion projects and the situation is further exacerbated due to this disparity in payments by the CPPA-G, CEO added. Kamran Kamal, in his letter, also stated that the power company is the first IPP which has participated in the country\u2019s generation capacity expansion by undertaking four growth projects worth more than $ 4 billion, which are included in CPEC. One of the China Power Hub Generation Company of 1,320 MW achieved Commercial Operation Date (COD) in 2019 and is supplying 9 billion units of uninterrupted and very economical power to meet the needs of more than 4 million households. One other project, Thar Energy Limited, a 330 MW indigenous coal-fired power plant is going through commissioning and is expected to declare COD later this month following by COD of another project of 330 MW Thal Nova (Pvt) Limited. Recently, Hubco has also entered into an agreement to acquire the ENI operations of Pakistan. The CEO of the company maintained that in this situation, Hubco expects to be treated fairly, at least at par with other IPPs, adding that a half of the first quarter Q1 FY 2022-23 has already lapsed, and the company reminds Secretary Power Division to keep to the commitment made to the company in the meeting in June 2022 that disparity would be addressed by the end of the quarter. The company has sought intervention and instructions by Secretary Power so that the disparity is addressed by the end of September 2022. CEO Hubco, in his letter, has further argued that an industry-wide FIFO in CPPA-G\u2019s payment system is implemented to achieve fairness and transparency, which would entail the invoices of all IPPs are sorted sequentially according to their due dates and are paid in the order of their due dates ensuring that the oldest invoices in CPPA-G system are paid first, irrespective of which IPP it relates to. This concern over disparity among IPPs will automatically be resolved. \u201cAll IPPs have working capital facilities to manage their liquidity, however, due to uncertainty of payment from CPPA-G, they continue to face liquidity challenges. The industry-wise FIFO would also provide certainty of cash flows as a result of which the IPPs would be able to better plan future operations, fuel procurement and lenders payments and manage their liquidity by efficiently utilizing their working capital facilities,\u201d CEO Hubco said adding that it would result in considerable time saving for the government and CPPA-G officials which can be more productively utilized.

According to him as of end of July 2022, Hubco\u2019s unpaid invoices were nine months overdue as compared to 1-3 months for similar IPPs. He has claimed that the amount of receivables of Hubco stood at Rs 43 billion of which Rs 6 billion were up to 1 month, Rs 9 billion up to 1-2 months, Rs 5 billion up to 2-3 months, Rs 12 billion up to 3-6 months and Rs 11 billion up to 6-9 months. This stock is excluding the disputed amount of Rs 11.5 billion. The stock of receivables of Kapco were Rs 46 billion, of which Rs 15 billion are up to 1 month, Rs 27 billion 1-2 months, Rs 4 billion 2-3 months but nothing is pending for 3-6 months and 6-9 months. The stock of receivable of Lalpir power company is Rs 1 billion while Pakgen\u2019s pending claims are Rs 8 billion for 1 month and Rs 3 billion for 1-2 months, totalling Rs 11 billion.  CEO Hubco maintained that CPPA-G\u2019s linking the payments to Economic Merit Order (EMO) is grossly misplaced and not supported by any agreement, adding that EMO only relates to energy payments whereas under the terms of Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), Hubco is also entitled to capacity payments based on its availability for which CPPA-G is obliged make timely payments, as well. Disregarding capacity payments because a plant is not being despatched is, in fact, against the spirit of PPA. He has sent the following para wise response to CPPA-G comments: (i) whereas the aging of overdue receivables in Hubco\u2019s letter includes the disputed amount of Rs. 11.525 billion, even after excluding the amount, its overdue receivables are considerably higher than similar IPPs in terms of their aging, i.e., 9 months as compared to 1-3 months for similar IPPs;(ii) the payments of 110% to 118% of verified invoices in the years 2020-21 and 2021-22 were primarily due to payments under PPA amendment agreement which were made to other IPPs, as well and does not resolve the issue of disparity.  Comparative aging of overdue receivables for similar IPPs should also be presented for meaningful analysis. CFO/ CEO CPPA-G may recall that pursuant to the PPA amendment agreement, the overdue balances as of November 30, 2020, were paid to IPPs in two instalments of 40% and 60% bringing the IPPs at par in terms of payment percentages and aging. Hubco fails to understand that subsequently how it can have an overdue aging of around 9 months whereas other similar IPPs have an aging of only 1-3 months. In meeting in June 2022, it was discussed and agreed that Hubco was lagging in terms of payments as compared to other IPPs and we were assured that this disparity would be resolved by September 2022. Unfortunately, the significant difference in overdue aging between Hubco and other IPPs persists which constrains us to raise this issue again;(iii) application of industry-wise FIFO is not going to conflict with economic merit order system as all IPPs will have a better visibility when their invoices will be paid and thus will be able to better plan their cash flows and operations with their working capital lines accordingly;(iv) the implementation of industry-wise FIFO will bring fairness and transparency in the payment system and redress the issue of disparity in payment as it discourages the exercise of discretion. On the other hand, exercising discretion and linking the payments to despatches has created inefficiencies and complacency leading to disparity in payments. Concluding the letter CEO Hubco said that as per the PPA, CPPA-G is under a contractual obligation to make timely payments. Hubco has always supported CPPA-G and GoP in running the energy system and whenever requested by CPPA-G and GoP, Hubco has sacrificed its own interest for the larger national interest. However, the present disparity in payments has forced the company to raise its serious concerns and reservations.  \u201cHubco expects to be treated fairly and requests that the issue of disparity is addressed by the end of this quarter as committed by CPPA-G to bring it\u2019s overdue aging in line with other similar IPPs,\u201d he said adding that as per the company\u2019s estimates, CPPA-G needs to pay a amount of Rs23 - 25 billion immediately to bring Hubco at par with similar IPPs.

The company said that the latest development would enhance the collective power generation capacity of HUBCO and its group companies to 3,251 MW through the plants spread over Balochistan, Punjab, Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Sindh. \u201cThe TEL project will be generating low cost energy from indigenous Thar coal thus reducing burden on national foreign exchange resource,\u201d it added.  The development comes as the incumbent government looks to enhance its electricity generation capacity by utilising indigenous sources to meet the country's energy needs. Earlier this month, Federal Minister for Energy Khurram Dastgir said as per his government\u2019s energy policy, every new electricity generation plant in   i.e. hydel, solar, wind and Thar coal.  The development is critical as the country seeks to lower the import of energy commodities that is burning a hole in the national kitty, especially in the wake of Russia-Ukraine conflict, which has sent prices of gas and coal soaring, leaving little space for net energy importing countries like Pakistan.

Shah said that he was proud to participate in the ceremony to celebrate transmission of electricity from Thar Energy Limited utilizing Thar coal. He congratulated HBCO and its partners FFC and CMEC, and also the project team for completion of the project despite multiple challenges. Murad Ali Shah said that his government has always considered Thar to be cornerstone of Energy Security of Pakistan and has taken all necessary steps to ensure that the dream of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto is implemented. \u201cHer vision has been vindicated as Thar coal prices are two to three times cheaper versus imported lignite while saving billions of dollars in foreign exchange,\u201d the CM said and added that the Sindh govt became major shareholder in first Thar coal mining company SECMC and also provided financial guarantee required by Chinese lenders to achieve financial close of the mine.

Shah said that the development of Thar coal has also brought positive changes in the life of local people as substantial CSR activities were being carried out in the fields of employment, education, medical facilities by Mining and Power generation Companies through Thar Foundation. Murad said that he was also working to ensure ramp up of mine quickly and utilization of Thar coal for energy needs of other industrial sectors including cement, fertilizers and others.  \u201cWe are also working closely with federal government to develop rail link for mass transportation of Thar coal,\u201d he said and added that the rail link project would start soon. Murad said that Thar Energy Ltd was a 330MW coal-fired power project based on Thar Coal. He added that it was part of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).  The project is a joint venture among Hub Power Company Ltd (Hubco), Fauji Fertilizer Company Ltd (FFC), China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) and has been completed at a cost of $520 million Foreign financing for the project was arranged from Chinese syndicate, led by China Development Bank whereas local financing has been arranged via a syndicate led by Habib Bank Ltd.  The project started construction in May 2018 from Sponsors\u2019 equity without waiting for financial close to ensure earliest utilization of indigenous Thar Coal. The Financial close of the Project was achieved in January 2020. The project experienced delays due to delays in loan disbursement from Chinese lenders and later due to Covid-19 pandemic.  The project is now in commissioning phase and the chief minister formally switched it on to synchronize it with National Grid on August 3 whereas COD is expected by August 20 to 28.

According to the Company Secretary, the letter is in relation to the notification issued by Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) of September 13, 2021 through which exemption from the application of Expected Credit Loss (ECL) method under IFRS-9 available to companies holding financial assets due from the Government of Pakistan in respect of circular debt was extended till June 30, 2022. The Power Company has highlighted that circular debt situation has continued to worsen as huge receivables have accumulated on books of LPTL and other IPPs. This is after steps have been taken to settle circular debt through settlements under the PPA amendment agreements signed with many IPPs wherein outstanding balances have been partially settled through payments in instalments. However, a lot more still needs to be done to address the issue of circular debt. The company believes that the complete resolution of circular debt will take some years depending upon the government\u2019s course of actions. \u201cIFRS-9 requires us to recognize a loss for the overdue receivables due mainly because of their aging. LPTL overdue amounts from CPPA-G are not by its own choice but are the direct result of circular debt. The application of the impairment model provided in IFRS-9 will result in huge impairment losses on these late overdue amounts resulting in significant dilution of profitability and erosion of our retained earnings,\u201d the letter notes adding that \u201ctherefore, the Company has requested Power Division to recommend to SECP for a permanent exemption from the application of IFRS-9 on trade debts on the same grounds as were applicable previously some of which are as follows: (i) application of IFRS- 9 will increase the variability of IPPs results from one period to another due to the abnormal payment pattern being followed by the Government of Pakistan (GoP). This volatility in results from one period to another may give misleading results to the users of the financial statements. Furthermore, as there is no firm timeline from CPPA-G for settlement of these receivables, it would be very difficult to estimate the loss. Also, different assumptions by different companies and auditors will significantly affect the comparability of numbers between different companies; (ii) impairment on government-guaranteed receivable will deteriorate the credibility of the GoP. This will end a negative image of the GOP to domestic and international investors and can hamper future foreign direct investments; (iii) the large impairment losses due to the application of IFRS-9 will deteriorate the already declining capital markets of the country as a result of panic amongst the shareholders of these IPPs; (iv) the impairment loss will also adversely impact the lenders\u2019 covenants and may result in breach of loan covenants. This will also negatively impact the ability of IPPs to borrow money in these times of financial crunch; (v) the application of IFRS-9 will restrict the ability of IPPs to declare dividends to their shareholders. \u201cThe IPPs are already severely suffering from the circular debt issue and will face additional negative financial impacts of impairment losses on their receivables which will hamper their ability to pay dividends to their shareholders as the impairment losses recognized will lower their available profits for distribution,\u201d LPTL\u2019s Company Secretary said, adding that given the facts and the prevailing circumstances, Power Division should facilitate in obtaining a permanent exemption for all IPPs facing circular debt issue from the application of IFRS-9 by recommending to SECP for issuing a requisite notification under the powers provided to SECP under Section 225(3) of the Companies Act, 2017.

Addressing the inauguration of commercial operations of Phase-II of Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company (SECMC) during his visit to Thar Coal Mines Block-II, he said the Thar Coal Project was high on the agenda for the government in view of reduced cost of power generation. The prime minister on the occasion inaugurated a 330MW Power Plant of Thar Energy Limited (TEL) and also inspected the construction site of SECMC Mine Phase-II at Islamkot. Shehbaz Sharif said not benefiting from the country\u2019s indigenous coal reserves was a huge mistake and announced to convene a meeting of stakeholders on Thar Coal mines next week to discuss the formalities.   He said the federal government, in collaboration with the Sindh government, would chalk out a policy framework on the Thar Coal Mines Project, with an objective to connect it with other coal-powered power plants in the country, producing 4,000 megawatts. He mentioned the international cost of coal had come down from $67 to $44 and had prospects of further reduction up to $30. The coal-powered plants, he said would prove to be a feasible operation for electricity production at the rate of Rs 10 per unit. The prime minister said Thar Coal project would save the country\u2019s foreign exchange and help thrive the national economy. On March 2023, he said the Thar Coal Mines Project would be connected through a freight rail track for the transportation of coal to other parts of the country. He lauded the Sindh government, Hubco, the Government of China, and the Chinese companies for training the local professionals and workers, and also appreciated the women working in the field including at water plants and dumping trucks. He expressed satisfaction that Thar was undergoing fast development after former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto first visited the area in the year 1996 and envisioned a prosperity plan for the locals. Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said that Thar, once used to be known for malnutrition, and infant and maternal mortality rate, had now emerged as a game-changer and a public-partnership model of development. He mentioned that the Thar Coal Mines project had contributed to the provision of job opportunities to the local people of Thar, thus improving their lifestyles.   He said under public-partnership projects, the barren desert of Thar was now witnessing crop irrigation and fish breeding even with the use of hard water. Bilawal stressed for replicating collaborative projects in other parts of the country and expressed confidence that the prime minister, with his inspiring \u2018Shehbaz Speed\u2019, would materialize the development plans at a fast pace. Chief Minister Sindh Murad Ali Shah said the Sindh government allocated 40 percent equity along with 60 percent contributed by Sindh Engro in the public-private partnership on Thar Coal mines project. He regretted that had the work on Thar coal not stalled since its first mining of reserves in 1991, the project would have produced 10,000 megawatts. He termed Sindh province as the \u2018energy basket of Pakistan\u2019, with immense potential of natural energy resources, including solar and wind energy. Chinese Ambassador Nong Rong congratulated the Government of Pakistan on the successful completion of the project and lauded Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for his \u201cconsistent devotion and firm support\u201d in strengthening Pakistan-China cooperation including in CPEC projects. He hoped that the new power bloc would help overcome energy shortage, and provide reliable and affordable electricity. The envoy thanked the Pakistan Army for providing foolproof security to the Chinese professionals working in the country. As an \u2018Iron Brother\u2019, he said China would be happy to continue assisting Pakistan to help it achieve prosperity. Chairman Hub Power Company Limited (Hubco) Habibullah Khan said Hubco continued to be Pakistan\u2019s largest Independent Power Producer and contributed $5 billion to the country in four CPEC projects. He said Hubco\u2019s investment in the production of the cheapest power was significant for ensuring long-term energy security in the country. Sindh Energy Minister and Chairman SECMC Imtiaz Ahmed Sheikh said the Thar energy power project would contribute to adding electricity to the national grid. He mentioned the support of Shanghai Electric Power Company Limited and the experts from China, who worked hard to materialize the project.

NPCC has written a number of letters to Power Division and other concerned ministries about criticality of fuel stocks but arrangements were not made by the previous government nor the incumbent government, due to which the entire country is facing massive loadshedding. According to sources, NPCC has apprised the government that due to severe heat wave prevailing in the country, the system load demand has increased drastically. Consequently, power plants are being operated at full capacity to meet system load demand in addition to load management due to generation shortfall. This has resulted in excessive fuel consumption and fast depletion of fuel reserves (RFO/ HSD& coal) due to less replenishment as compared to consumption. Power plants have time and again communicated their apprehension regarding their inability to maintain obligatory fuel stock on account of non-payment by CPPA-G.  NPCC has also shared fuel stock replenishment and consumption at different power plants with the concerned quarters. Recently, Sahiwal Coal Power Plant desynchronized unit # 02 (621 MW) on May 16, 2022 in addition to operation of unit # 01 on part load (330 MW) causing outage of 912 MW from the complex on pretext of low coal reserves.   Moreover, China Hub coal inventory is also depleting very fast which may eventually lead to generation outage from the complex. This will further aggravate the situation causing severe capability shortfall. The total capacity on forced outage due to fuel shortage and technical fault as on May 16, 2022 was 4,933 MW. Of this, 3,572 MW capacity is under forced outage due to fuel shortage from May 16, 2022. RLNG capacity of 1,050 MW is out from system since May 5, 2022, GTPS Faisalabad (5-9) 120 MW from December 13 2021, Jamshoro power plant 649 MW from April 18, 2022, Muzaffargarh 840 MW since April 8, 2022, Sahiwal coal unit- 1 292 MW, and unit -2, 621 are non-operational since May 16, 2002. The sources said, 1,361 MW electricity is on forced outage due to technical fault which includes Port Qasim unit-2 of 621 MW since May 7, 2022, Uch-I, 195 MW since May 15, Genco-II (85 MW TPS Guddu unit -5) and Genco-II (90 MW TPS Guddu-8), since May 14. There is no definite date for these plants to restart operation. However, Genco-II (370 MW unit 14 of Guddu 747 MW) which is shut since February 12, 2021, is expected to be start operation from June 15, 2022. NPCC argues that due to schedule outage of K-2 (for refueling), variability in RLNG supply to power sector and high system load demand, the availability of coal fired and RFO/HSD based power plants is of vital importance for the smooth operation of power system, and has requested the government to advise CPPA-G for necessary payments to all power plants well in time for building up their fuel stock as per their relevant PPAs and to avoid severe generation capability shortfall and additional load management in the ongoing scorching heat wave. The availability of fuel stocks on following power plants is far less than their requirement: (i) Hubco 3,849 tons; (ii) Kapco (LSFO) 12, 275 tons; (iii) AES Lalpir, 5,609 tons; (iv) AES Pakgen, 1,250 tonns; (v) SABA, 1,678 tons; (vi) Atlas Power, 1,265 tons; (vii) HubcoNarowal, 2,383 tons; (viii) Liberty Tech, 3,880 tons; (ix) Nishat Power, 123 tons; (x) Orient Power (HSD) 1,214 tons; (xi) Halmore (HSD) 1,914 tons; (xii) Kapco-III (HSD) 41 tons; and (xiii) Baloki (HSD) 3, 169 tons. Meanwhile, PSO has apprised the government that it has not received any confirmation by MoE (Power Division) regarding fuel requirement for June-August, 2022 till date. Furthermore, as per letter no. 4(50)/2021-NTDC forwarded on May 06, 2022 LSFO demand is 131,907 MTs for the month of June, 2022, whereas KAPCO has confirmed to scrap the cargoes via letter of May 10, 2022 for the first fortnight (01-15) of June, 2022 and accordingly PSO will not award any LSFO cargo for the first fortnight and supply volume for the month of June 2022 will be reduced proportionally. PSO has requested Power Division to confirm the HSFO requirement for the month of June, 2022 by May 12, 2022 enabling it to firm up its supply plan in order to avoid any untoward situation. Last week, Power Division informed the Federal Cabinet that an unprecedented rise in international fuel prices had resulted in a substantive rise in the cost of generation. The price of coal, in particular, had increased from 9100 per M ton to $300 per M ton (May 22 US$ 300/M ton). To maintain the supply chain of coal, Rs 100 billion was required as an additional supplementary grant as equity in former WAPDA electricity Discos, over and above the budgeted and approved subsidies. This additional supplementary grant would be used to pay imported coal-based IPPs against their overdue payables for timely procurement of the coal inventory. The Cabinet was informed that in case the required supplementary grant of Rs.100 billion was not approved, further purchase of coal inventory would be suspended till such time that international coal prices were substantially lower. This disruption of coal supply chain would result in stoppage of the IPPs (3900 MW). Consequently, about two-hour system-wide load-shedding would have to be scheduled in the month of June, three hours in July, and four in August. The Federal Cabinet set up a Sub-Committee on Energy, under the chairmanship of Minister for Power to prepare a viable plan for load-shedding during the coming summer months, keeping in view the financial constraints. The plan to be submitted within 10 days, shall strike a balance between the proposed load-shedding duration in the urban and rural areas.

However, the actual upliftment by the power plants has been significantly less in comparison to Power Division demand, as well as, customer demand during this period. During this period, only 545,000 MTS product has been uplifted from PSO against supply plan of 1,044,000 MTs with shortfall of approx. 400,000 MTs whereas Power Division demand for this period was 1,406,000 MTs. As a result, PSO has been facing severe ullage issues to offload its cargoes causing excessive demurrages and upliftment from refineries has also been badly affected in addition to the cash flow issues faced by PSO. The sources said in the view of demand and upliftment scenario and the demand received from Power Division and customers, PSO has also firmed up its supply plan for the month of September, 2022. Based on available fuel oil stock, local refinery avails and previously awarded two HSFO cargoes (deferred from August first fortnight to end of August and September first fortnight respectively) PSO has not awarded any additional HSFO or LSFO cargoes for the month of September, 2022.  Based on the existing considerable variance in demand vs upliftment during this period, PSO has requested to revisit the plant wise RFO requirement shared for the month of October, 2022 in its letter of August 25, 2022. \u201cPSO has sought response / update from Power Division in this matter for RFO requirement with plant-wise break-up for Nov 22 \u2013 Dec 22, enabling PSO to firm up its supply plan accordingly keeping in view of import cycle of minimum 60 days. Accordingly, PSO\u2019s tentative HSFO/ LSFO supply plan September, 2022 for its contractual customers is as follows: Hubco\u2019s demand was 80,000 MT whereas Power Division demand was 10,910 MT which is being met. The demand from Lalpir/ Pakgen was 58,000 MT against demand of 71,400 MT of Power Division; however, PSO will supply 58,000 MT. Furnace oil demand of Kohinoor Energy was 9,000 MT whereas Power Division forwarded demand of 16,374 MT. PSO has met demand submitted by the power plant (customer). PSO will supply 5,000 MT to Muzaffargarh (Genco III) and 10,000 MT to Jamshoro (Genco 1). Of the PSO\u2019s non-contractual customers, Saba Power is receiving 8,000 MT against Power Division\u2019s demand of 4,200 MT, Liberty Power Tech Limited, 5,000 MT against Power Division demand of 20,663 MT, Nishat Power Chunian, 6,000 MT verses 21,276 MT demand forwarded by Power Division, Nishat Power Limited 5,000 MT against Power Division\u2019s demand of 18,673 MT.  The sources maintained that total demand of HSFO placed by customers was 181,000 MT, against Power Division demand of 163,000, whereas PSO will supply 116,916 MT. The demand from Kot Addu Power Plant (KAPCO) was 140,000 MT whereas PSO will supply 60,000 MT despite demand of 44,850 MT placed by Power Division. KAPCO cancelled cargoes of first and second fortnight for the month of September.  Total demand of PSO\u2019s RFO was 321,000 MT for September whereas PSO will supply 176,916 MT against demand of 208,352 MT placed by the Power Division. PSO only supplied approximately 91,661 MTs against the revised supply plan of approximate 188,164 MTs with a shortfall of approximate 96,503 MTs during the month of August, 2022 due to upliftment/ order placement and delay in payments from various power plants. As a result, PSO has been facing ullage constraints to offload its cargoes, and upliftment from refineries was also affected.  PSO maintains that tentative supply plan for September is subject to timely payment or orders from respective Genco\u2019s/ IPPs. Any deviation from this will affect supplies to customers.  PSO maintains that customers receipt may vary from daily plan due to transit time. Supplies from Karachi have 2-3 day transmit time.

It\u2019s also been reported in sections of the press, and not yet denied by the government, that the three imported coal-fired power plants \u2014 Hubco, Sahiwal and Port Qasim \u2014 have also closed one of their two units due to unavailability of fuel. And when these matters were brought before the last finance minister, Shaukat Tarin, he could do little more than extend a partial payment of Rs50 billion. Given the circumstances it makes sense for the government to proceed with abolishing the CPEC Authority because it\u2019s clearly \u201ca redundant organisation with a huge waste of resources which has thwarted speedy implementation of CPEC,\u201d according to Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal.  But PML-N would probably have axed it anyway because it was against a parallel setup even when the project took off. And the Authority remained largely dormant although the PTI (Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf) government invested a good two years in setting it up. It only very reluctantly enacted the CPEC Authority Act in May 2021 but even then it never filled the position of the chairman after Lt-Gen Asim Saleem Bajwa (retd) first made it controversial and then resigned from it. There are also lingering issues about setting up a revolving account, which Pakistan was supposed to do but never came round to doing, and delays in certain projects arising from sudden change in taxation policies by the last government in clear violation of commitments made to Beijing.  Under pressure from the IMF (International Monetary Fund), most likely, the government simply withdrew sales tax exemptions on imports. Ahsan Iqbal had a lot more to say as well about how the PTI administration allegedly ran this rare game-changing opportunity into the ground; like making \u201czero progress on industrial zones being set up at Port Qasim, Islamabad, and Mirpur.\u201d While details about what exactly went wrong over the last few years are only beginning to trickle through, it\u2019s been pretty clear for a while that Pakistan\u2019s inability to make timely payments to Chinese investors and provide adequate safety to their workers is a big part of the problem.  With terrorist attacks on the rise and the financial squeeze getting worse by the day, it\u2019s not immediately clear how long the new government is going to need to solve these issues. But it has already sounded the alarm, and also a very serious warning, because if this precious chance is also wasted then there\u2019s no way that Pakistan is going to be able to bring its infrastructure up to speed with the 21st century. The CPEC is truly a game-changing opportunity for Pakistan and the only reason it\u2019s such an integral part of China\u2019s much bigger BRI (Belt and Road Initiative) is our strategic geographic location that no other country can match; not some notions of higher-than-mountains and deeper-than-oceans friendship that we have with the Chinese.  Sadly, so far we\u2019ve just wasted this opportunity to give the country\u2019s social overhead capital a desperately needed facelift; and now even excited foreign investors are losing interest. SEZs (Special Economic Zones) for example, prompted investors to line up to be part of the project in 2017. But needless delays that forced them to miss the 2020 deadline to be up and running also disappointed a lot of investors and now the tide has almost completely turned. Hopefully, the corrective measures will not end just with scrapping the CPEC Authority. It has to be not just about identifying mistakes and oversights, but also correcting them. Short of that, no amount of noise about who did what wrongly and why, is going to revive China\u2019s interest or get the project back on its feet. Only dotting all the Is, crossing all the Ts, and blocking all the holes will work.

However, power load-shedding has only increased since. Now the blame is on the previous government that they have delayed the commissioning of some plants that were conceived and planned during the PML-N (Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz) tenure (2013-18). The media strategy is to pass the buck on to the others just as the PTI (Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf) government was doing for the rise in circular debt during its tenure by accusing the PML-N government of failing to initiate more than needed number of plants. The basic issue today is not of capacity as there is enough baseload generation capacity in the system to achieve nearly zero load-shedding. That was the case last year too as there was no or little load-shedding. However, the problem is quite different today. The issue is not about the competence of PML-N or PTI. Whosoever would have been governing today, the result would be similar. The problem is financial in nature. International prices of coal, RLNG and furnace oil are too high for the country to afford, given its precarious balance of payment situation. At such a high fuel cost, the government finds itself unable to pass on this through increase in tariffs proportionately. Not doing so would exert pressure on the fiscal balance. Furthermore, at such a high-cost generators (Independent Power Producers) too are reluctant to generate at full capacity as they find it hard to finance the growing circular debt. These are the basic reasons for the high load-shedding scenario today. Had there been additional capacity available on imported fuel, the fate of power generation would be no different. For example, the government is claiming that the PTI government had delayed the Punjab Thermal Power Limited (on RLNG) by 26 months. And this is leading to higher load-shedding. However, the shortfall of load generation on RLNG by existing three power plants was of 785MW as on 30th June 2022. This is due to not buying LNG at exorbitant spot rates. It is a right decision. The net capacity of four plants based on imported coal \u2014 Sahiwal Coal, Port Qasim Coal, China Hub Power and Lucky Electric \u2014 shows a shortfall of 34,283MW. Three of these four plants are operating at sub-optimal level as the government has decided against using the insanely high priced imported coal for power generation as it would not be able to recover the cost.  Moreover, it cannot afford an additional strain on current account deficit. Last year, these plants were running at maximum capacity as coal prices were a mere fraction of what these are today. There are some transmission constraints that hamper the ability of China Power and Port Qasim plants to run at full throttle simultaneously. Lucky Electric, which runs on lignite coal (whose price is lower), was, however, closed due to technical reasons. Now it is back on the grid. Similar is the story of plants running on furnace oil \u2014 such as Hubco. One nuclear plant (K2) is closed due to refuelling outage. Thus overall shortfall from big reliable power plants was of around 7,000MW as of 30th June 2022. The \u2018woes\u2019 of majority of these are due to non-availability of imported fuel. Some were closed due to technical reasons. The government has been arguing that the shortage is due to the previous government\u2019s inability to bring five power plants of around 4,000MW online in time.  Well, last year the thorny issue was of capacity payments and the then government deliberately delayed some projects to lower the burden of capacity payment. And there was no load-shedding as such. The case would have been the same today had the fuel prices remained low. These plants are likely to be online by the next summer. In other words, if fuel prices normalise by the next summer, there would be no load-shedding.  And there would be less load-shedding in the remaining summer this year. Our hydel capacity is close to 10,000MW and half of it is not being obtained (end June) due to non-availability of water. That is a seasonal issue. With the onset of monsoon and glaciers melting, water availability would be better in coming months. Plus, the load on the national grid would be less due to falling temperatures. The hard time has perhaps passed; the problem is in the long-term planning as for majority of the power plants of IPPs established under the 1994, 2002, and 2015 policies were envisaged on imported fuel. The lack of reliance on local coal and other fuel options has created this systemic problem, especially in days of high global fuel prices. The need is to fix this and to focus on indigenous fuel to generate power.

The company is engaged in conducting exploration, prospecting, development and production of oil and natural gas resources. The company\u2019s current exploration and production portfolio is spread across Pakistan with international presence in Iraq and Yemen. PPL also holds mineral rights in Balochistan through Bolan Mining Enterprise (BME), a 50:50 joint operations between PPL and Government of Balochistan. Its history dates back to the establishment of a public limited company in 1950, with major\u00a0shareholding\u00a0by\u00a0Burmah\u00a0Oil Company (BOC) of the United Kingdom for exploration, prospecting, development and production of oil and natural gas resources. In 1997, BOC\u00a0disinvested\u00a0from the E&P sector worldwide and sold its equity in\u00a0PPL\u00a0to the Government of Pakistan. Later, the GoP reduced its holding through an IPO in 2004, which was further decreased with the initiation of the\u00a0Benazir\u00a0Employees Stock Option Scheme (BESOS) in 2009. Further divestment of another 5 percent shares in a secondary public offering occurred in 2014. PPL has three fully-owned subsidiaries: PPL Europe E&P Limited (PPLE) which was previously called MND\u00a0E&P Limited, PPL Asia E&P B.V. (PPLA) and Pakistan Petroleum Provident Fund Trust Company (Private) Limited (PPPFTC). The Group, except PPPFTC, is engaged in conducting exploration, prospecting, development and production of oil and natural gas resources. At present, PPL\u2019s\u00a0shareholding\u00a0is divided between the government, which owns about 68 percent,\u00a0PPL\u00a0Employees Empowerment Trust that has a little over\u00a07 percent and private investors, who hold nearly 25 percent. A breakup of categories of shareholders with respective share in both the ordinary shares and convertible preference shares is shown in the illustration. The oil and gas exploration and production has seen growth in profits over the years. PPL\u2019s margins have also been improving as it is a major oil and gas company working aggressively towards hydrocarbons drilling. However, over the years, decline in gas production has been faced by gas producing companies. Back in FY13, though the firm continued to see growth in profits, the gas production dwindled due to depleting gas reserves in the country; PPL\u2019s decline in gas production came from the firm\u2019s pioneering fields like Sui, Miano, Kandhot and Sawan as they continued to mature. The production however, was compensated by higher crude oil production and better gas prices. In FY14, higher crude oil prices and crude oil production and discoveries lifted PPL\u2019s earnings. Earnings took a hit in FY15 however, due to lower oil prices, which continued in FY16 along with contraction in gas production volumes. Recovery in oil prices in FY17 was welcomed by the E&P sector, where PPL announced a whopping increase in its earnings largely led by revenue growth, which was around 46 percent year-on-year, while the earnings grew more than twice on a year-on-year basis. Also in FY17, the firm received gas price adjustment of Rs31.12 billion for 25 months starting June 2015 to June 2017, which boosted the top-line along with improvement in natural gas output from its key fields, Sui and Kandhot. Its overall production exceeded the firm\u2019s long time average of 1 bcfd, registering a growth of around 8 percent year-on-year.\u00a0 Lower finance costs also helped the earnings of FY17. Exploration costs also remained on the lower side in FY17 in spite of the firm\u2019s aggressive drilling activity. During FY17, PPL drilled 28 development wells, out of which 15 were drilled in areas operated exclusively by the company, while 13 wells were drilled in areas operated by the company\u2019s partners. FY18 was another promising year for the upstream sector because of the upward trend in oil prices. Higher oil prices continued to complement PPL\u2019s financial performance in FY18. The company reaped benefits of investing in exploration and drilling during low oil price years as it earned the second highest profit in its history in FY18. During the year, PPL drilled 11 exploration wells in operated areas including 3 wells in frontier areas, whereas 7 exploration wells were drilled in partner-operated areas. The firm also made a discovery PPL-operated area. The company also drilled 15 development wells, which include 8 in operated areas and 7 development wells in partner-operated areas. The annual report highlights that the firm was able to arrest the decline in maturing fields through a year-on-year production increase from Gambat South, Adhi, Tal and Kirthar fields. On the production side, PPL\u2019s gas and oil production marginally declined by 1.9 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively in FY18, whereas LPG production increased by 17.3 percent on a year-on-year basis. Despite a decline in volumes, higher oil prices and massive rupee depreciation resulted in 8 percent year-on-year increase in revenues for PPL for FY18. Earnings for the company for the year increased by 28 percent, year-on-year, and the main reasons for higher profitability were increase in sales revenue and other income and decline in other charges and levies. This was partially offset by increase in operating expenditures.\u00a0 The increase in other income came from exchange gain, receipt of signature bonus from UEPL against farm out of Kotri North block, and receipt of late payment surcharge from Asia Resources Oil Limited. On the other hand, the decline other charges were due to recording of impairment loss on investment in wholly owned subsidiary, PPL Asia E&P B.V (PPLA) in FY17. In FY18, PPL continued to face the pressure from the circular debt. As per the Annual Report 2017-18, receivables increased from Rs99 billion as at June 30, 2017 to Rs143 billion as at June 30, 2018, which is making the liquidity, position of the company an immediate concern. In FY19, significant currency depreciation lifted PPL\u2019s earnings. The company announced a 35 percent year-on-year increase in unconsolidated bottom-line for FY19. PKR lost more than 30 percent of its value since the start of the fiscal year and while currency depreciation has a potentially adverse impact on costs, it has a positive effect on the company\u2019s revenues as these are mostly linked with USD. PPL\u2019s top-line witnessed a growth of 30 percent year-on-year. Amid flattish growth in volumetric sales of oil and gas and some recovery in oil prices, the growth in revenues had largely to do with currency devaluation during the year. In FY19, PPL\u2019s production has declined again marginally by around 1.7 percent year-on-year, whereas Condensate/NGL/Oil & LPG production increased by approximately 1.3 and 22 percent year-on-year, respectively. According to the annual report, the primary reason for decrease in gas production is the natural decline from mature fields; however this has been partially offset by increase in production from Gambat South and proactive production management. Increase in oil production from Adhi contributed to the overall growth in oil production, while the increase in LPG is attributed to the recently commissioned Nashpa LPG plant by PPL. During the year, PPL made 6 discoveries in operated areas while 5 discoveries were made in partner operated areas. The company spudded 7 exploration wells in operated areas and 5 wells in partner operated areas. 3 operated wells were spud in frontier areas as the company is now looking into high risk high reward wells as well. The other boost by currency devaluation came at the other income that grew by 77 percent in FY19. Growth in other income was also due reversal of impairment loss on investment in PPL Europe E&P Limited. However, on the expense side, despite lower exploration and prospecting activity PPL\u2019s exploration expenditure increased by over two times due to the incorporation of offshore Kekra-1 dry well cost. At the same time finance cost also grew by 76 percent, adding to the factors dragging the earnings of the E&P giant. Recently PPL announced that it is increasing its authorised share capital by Rs10 billion, which is 1 billion ordinary shares and can be seen in the company announcing a 20 percent bonus share for ordinary shareholders and 10 percent bonus shares for convertible preference shareholders besides the Rs2 per share cash dividend along with the FY19 financial performance. The company\u2019s liquidity continued to deteriorate due to the circular debt. The trade debts of the company reached to a historically high level of Rs227 billion versus Rs143 billion as on June 30, 2018 - translating into 1.1 times of gross revenue. However, the company continues to play an aggressive role in the country\u2019s hydrocarbon drilling. It is participating in the upcoming exploration bid rounds and is planning to expand its international portfolio. As per the annual report, the company has become the country\u2019s first public sector E&P to drill a well internationally with the spud-in of Madain X-1 in Iraq in 2019.

PPL operates 10 producing fields that include Sui, Kandhkot, Adhi, Mazarani, Chachar, Adam, Adam West, Shahdadpur, Shahdadpur East and Shahdadpur West; and holds working interest in around 17 partner-operated producing fields that include Qadirpur, Miano, Sawan and the famous Tal Block. \nPPL has three fully-owned subsidiaries: PPL Europe E&P Limited (PPLE), PPL Asia E&P B.V.

On the other hand, volumetric growth dropped slightly during the period. Crude oil sales volume decline by one percent, while gas volumes slipped by two percent year-on-year in 9MFY19. \nThe firm's margins increased and beside the growth in sales revenues, reversal of impairment loss on investment in PPLE and higher exchange gains lifted margins. On the other hand, higher operating costs, royalties and higher exploration and prospecting expenditure offset the growth rate in earnings. \nThe company witnessed a 76 percent year-on-year growth in exploration and prospecting expenditure in 9MFY19 that came from high cost of dry wells charged in the current period, and also from the recovery of past cost from United Energy Limited against farm out of the company's 50 percent working interest in Kotri North Block along with transfer of operatorship, Overall, PPL's net profit after tax stood 36 percent year-on-year higher in 9MFY19. \nDuring the latest nine-month period, PPL made the highest number of discoveries in the E&P sector: 6 in PPL-operated blocks and 2 in partner-operated blocks. In addition to that, one discovery was made in PPL Europe (formerly known as MND Exploration & Production) as well in a partner-operated block in Balochistan. Five wells were spudded during the period that included 4 exploratory and 1 development well.

The Privatization Division has set a target to divest 7 percent government shares in the OGDCL and 10 percent in the PPL offered to strategic partners with one seat in the board of directors of these two mega oil and gas companies. \nThe government has estimated to generate Rs 48 billion through divestment of 7 percent (301 million shares) of the OGDCL and another Rs 40 billion from 10 percent (226 million shares) which the Privatisation Division has planned to offer by the end of current financial year. However, no reference prices or discount on shares has been decided yet. \nThe federal government has revised the target of revenue to be generated through privatization of state-owned entities from Rs 150 to Rs 300 billion for current financial year 2019-20. The proceeds of divestment of these shares will be 30 percent of total targeted revenue to be collected through the privatisation in 2019-20. \nThe National Assembly Standing Committee on Privatisation met under the chairmanship of Syed Mustafa Mahmud and discussed in length the privatisation of the OGDCL, PLL, Guddu Power Plant and Nandipur Power Plant. \nSecretary Privatisation Division Rizwan Malik briefed the committee on the status of privatisation of these entities which have been placed in the active list of privatization. \nHe said that the divestment of shares of OGDCL and PPL would be completed by June 2020; however, the sale of two Gencos, Guddu Power Plant and Nandipur Power Plant, would be completed in the first or second quarter of financial year 2020-2021. \nThe secretary said that the Privatization Commission invited expression of interest for appointment of Financial Advisory Consortium and issued request for proposal (RFP) to three interested parties - CLSA Limited, Alfalah Securities and UBL; Credit Suisse, Arif Habib Ltd and AKD Securities; Citi, HBL and Next Capital. Due date for submission of technical and financial proposal is December 09, 2019. \"A strategic partner is required to discover the true profit of its privatization,\" he added. \nThe chief financial officer (CFO) informed the committee that the OGDCL is the market leader in almost all the aspects of up-stream sector including acreage, seismic, reserves and production. The OGDCL is a debt free company, contributing Rs 160 billion to national exchequer. The government of Pakistan holds 74.97 percent interest while 10.05 percent shares are with Benazir Employees Stock Option Scheme. The OGDCL is producing 47 percent of oil and 29 percent of gas out of the total country's production during 2019-20. Its net sale was Rs 261.481 billion and profit after tax was Rs 1,178.3 million during financial year 2018-19. During the fiscal year 2018-19, about 16 wells were drilled including nine exploratory and seven development wells. \nIn his briefing, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of PPL Ihtisham Ahmed said that Privatization Commission Board approved divestment up to 10 percent share of the PPL held by the government to the institutional investors through block sale. The PPL is the pioneer in oil and gas field in the country. It has 10 board members including managing director, four government directors and five independent directors. The government of Pakistan holds 67.5 percent while 7.4 percent shares are held by Benazir Employees Stock Option Scheme and their remaining 25 percent shares have been offered for free float. \nThe Privatisation Commission issued the RFP to two interest parties: CLSA Limited and Alfalah Securities; and Credit Suisse, Arif Habib Ltd and Topline Securities. \nThe committee deferred the remaining agenda regarding Guddu and Nandipur Power Plants and decided that a separate meeting would be convened to get the full spectrum on the detailed discussion. \nEarlier, the secretary privatization said that both the power plants were running into profit of Rs 4 billion which turned into Rs 11 billion loss due to non-adjustment of fuel charges. The matter was under consideration of the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra). \nHe further elaborated that four inquiries related to corruption in Nandipur Power Plant have been pending in the National Accountability Bureau (NAB). \"We don't know how much time the NAB takes to complete the investigation,\" he said.

The company is engaged in conducting exploration, prospecting, development and production of oil and natural gas resources with its production portfolio is spread across the country and international presence in Iraq and Yemen. PPL also holds mineral rights in Balochistan through Bolan Mining Enterprise (BME), a 50:50 joint operations between PPL and Government of Balochistan. PPL\u2019s history is as old as 1950, when Burmah\u00a0Oil Company (BOC) of the United Kingdom has the largest shareholding in the company for exploration, prospecting, development and production of oil and natural gas resources. In 1997, BOC\u00a0disinvested\u00a0from the E&P sector worldwide, which included selling its equity in\u00a0PPL\u00a0to the Government of Pakistan. Over the years, the GoP has reduced its holding first through an IPO in 2004, followed by a further decrease with the initiation of the\u00a0Benazir\u00a0Employees Stock Option Scheme (BESOS) in 2009, and a 5 percent divestment in a secondary public offering in 2014. The government is now looking to divest another 10 percent of PPL\u2019s shares for which it has approved the financial advisors. At present, PPL\u2019s\u00a0shareholding\u00a0is divided between the government, which owns about 68 percent,\u00a0PPL\u00a0Employees Empowerment Trust that has a little over\u00a07 percent and private investors, who hold nearly 25 percent. A breakup of categories of shareholders with respective share in both the ordinary shares and convertible preference shares is shown in the illustration. PPL has three fully-owned subsidiaries: PPL Europe E&P Limited (PPLE) which was previously called MND\u00a0E&P Limited, PPL Asia E&P B.V. (PPLA) and Pakistan Petroleum Provident Fund Trust Company (Private) Limited (PPPFTC). The Group, except PPPFTC, is engaged in conducting exploration, prospecting, development and production of oil and natural gas resources. PPL has been one of the key performers in the domestic oil and gas exploration and productions sector. However, over the years, decline in gas production has resulted in stagnation in the E&P sector. Back in FY13, though the firm continued to see growth in profits, the gas production dwindled due to depleting gas reserves in the country; PPL\u2019s decline in gas production came from the its pioneering fields like Sui, Miano, Kandhot and Sawan as they continued to mature. The production however, was compensated by higher crude oil production and better gas prices. In FY14, again the earnings were compensated by higher crude oil prices and crude oil production and discoveries. However, Earnings took a hit in FY15 due to lower oil prices, which continued in FY16 and remained an impediment for the sector along with contraction in gas production volumes. Recovery in oil prices in FY17 was a breather for the E&P sector, where PPL announced a whopping increase in its earnigns largely led by revenue growth, which was around 46 percent year-on-year. Earnigns grew more than twice on ayear-on-year basis. Also in FY17, the firm received gas price adjustment of Rs31.12 billion, which boosted the topline along with improvement in natural gas production from key fields.\u00a0 PPL\u2019s overall production exceeded the firm\u2019s long time average of 1 bcfde, registering a growth of around 8 percent year-on-year.\u00a0 Lower finance costs also helped the earnings of FY17. Exploration costs also remained on the lower side in FY17 in spite of the firm\u2019s aggressive drilling activity. FY18 was another favourable year for the upstream sector because of the upward trend in oil prices. Higher oil prices continued to complement PPL\u2019s financial performance as the company reaped benefits of investing in exploration and drilling during low oil price years and earned the second highest profit in its history during FY18. According to the FY18 annual report, the firm was able to arrest the decline in maturing fields through a year-on-year production increase from Gambat South, Adhi, Tal and Kirthar fields. On the production side, PPL\u2019s gas and oil production continued to witness slow growth. \u00a0Despite a decline in volumes, higher oil prices and massive rupee depreciation resulted in 8 percent year-on-year increase in revenues for PPL for FY18. Earnings for the company for the year increased by 28 percent, year-on-year in FY18, which was also supported by higher other income and decline in other charges and levies. This was partially offset by increase in operating expenditures.\u00a0 The increase in other income came from exchange gain, receipt of signature bonus from UEPL against farm out of Kotri North block, and receipt of late payment surcharge from Asia Resources Oil Limited. On the other hand, the decline other charges were due to recording of impairment loss on investment in wholly owned subsidiary, PPL Asia E&P B.V (PPLA) in FY17. In FY18, PPL continued to face the pressure from the circular debt. As per the Annual Report 2017-18, receivables increased from Rs99 billion as at June 30, 2017 to Rs143 billion as at June 30, 2018 In FY19, significant currency depreciation lifted PPL\u2019s earnings. The company announced a 35 percent year-on-year increase in unconsolidated bottmline for FY19. PKR lost more than 30 percent of its value during the year; and while the costs were adversely impacted, it had a positive effect on the company\u2019s revenues as these are mostly linked with USD. PPL\u2019s topline witnessed a growth of 30 percent year-on-year. Amid flattish growth in volumetric sales of oil and gas and some recovery in oil prices, the growth in revenues had largely to do with currency devaluation during the year. In FY19, PPL\u2019s gas production of has declined again marginally by around 1.7 percent year-on-year, whereas Condensate/NGL/Oil & LPG production increased by approximately 1.3 and 22 percent year-on-year, respectively. decline in gas volumes was due to natural decline from mature fields, however it was being partially offset by increase in production from Gambat South and proactive production management. Increase in oil production from Adhi contributed to the overall growth in oil production. Currency devaluation also positively affected other income that grew by 77 percent in FY19. Growth in other income was also due reversal of impairment loss on investment in PPL Europe E&P Limited. However, on the expense side, despite lower exploration and prospecting activity PPL\u2019s exploration expenditure increased by over two times due to the incorporation of offshore Kekra-1 dry well cost. PPL also announced that it is increasing its authorized share capital by Rs10 billion, and the company announced a 20 percent bonus share for ordinary shareholders and 10 percent bonus shares for convertible preference shareholders for that. The company\u2019s liquidity continued to deteriorate due to the circular debt. The trade debts of the company reached to a historically high level of Rs227 billion inFY19 versus Rs143 billion as on June 30, 2018 -\u00a0 translating into 1.1 times of gross revenue. PPL posted flat earnings growth in 1QFY20. PPL\u2019s revenues increased by over 9 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of FY20. \u00a0With missing volumetric sales growth, the growth in the company\u2019s topline was likely due to increase in indexation factor because the oil prices also declined during the period. The decline in volumes was largely due to natural decline from maturing fields and lower offtake by SNGPL during July and August 2019 due to load management issues arising from the import of LNG. The company\u2019s other charges doubled and other income slipped by more than half during 1QFY20 on a year-on-year basis. According to the the Director\u2019s report, the decline in other income and the increase in other charges stemmed from exhange losses in the current period as compared to exchange gain in the previous corresponding period and impairment loss on investment in PPL Asia in 1QFY20 versus a reversal of impairment on investment in PPL Europe in 1QFY19. However, the company continues to play an aggressive role in the country\u2019s hydrocarbon drilling. It is participating in the upcoming exploration bid rounds to expand and diversify its exploration portfolio. PPL planning to expand its international portfolio and reportedly plans to export up to 400,000 barrels of crude produced from its Gambat South Block.

The Cabinet Committee on Privatization (CCoP), in its meeting held on August 21, 2020, approved the proposals of Privatization Commission regarding offloading of 7 and 10 per cent stakes in OGGCL and PPL, respectively. The CCoP further directed the Ministry of Privatization to proceed expeditiously with all privatization transactions. The process may be slow due to market conditions.  . The CCoP, in its meeting held on August 26, 2019 approved the inclusion of ten PSEs (with divestment of up to 10 per cent shares held by GoP) in active privatization list and directed PC to publish expression of interest for hiring of an FA (financial adviser), on case to case basis. Accordingly, PC after conducting due procurement process approved to appoint the FA for divestment of PPL shares on January 28, 2020. While the FA Services Agreement was being negotiated, capital market dynamics changed significantly owing to Covid-19 pandemic. In this regard, a consultative meeting with Secretary, Petroleum Division was held on March 5, 2020 under the chairmanship of Minister for Privatization, wherein, Petroleum Division was requested to submit its views to PC on the matter as per a discussion held in the meeting. Accordingly, Petroleum Division submitted the following suggestions: \"Petroleum Division is of the view that presently the share price trend in the capital market is not conducive for divestment of GOP's shares from OGDCL and PPL. Further, the documented mode of divestment is time consuming and not likely for the transaction closure completion during the current financial year 2019-20. As such, Petroleum Division would recommend that divestment of GOP's share from OGDCL and PPL may be deferred for next .financial year 2020- 21 depending upon the share price trend in the capital market. Accordingly, Privatization Commission may consider divestment of GOP's share up to 10% and 18.39% from OGDCL and PPL to strategic investors during the financial year 2020-21 to attract Foreign Direct Investment and introduction of latest expertise in the E&P sector for the benefit of the country.\" PC carried out a divestment of 5% shares of PPL in June 2014 at a share price of Rs.219 ($ 2.22/share). A closer look at the recent trend reflect volatility with a low of Rs.69 ($0.43/share) at end of March 2020 and is being traded around Rs 99 ($0 0.59/share) on August 10, 2020. One of the prime reasons for a big dip in the share price of E&P sector is the historically lowest prices of crude oil in the international market. The matter, including the Petroleum Division's suggestion was discussed in the Privatization Board meeting held on July 22 and 29, 2020 and the PC Board, after thorough deliberations approved and recommended for divestment of up to 10 per cent of GoP's shares in PPL followed by divestment up to 7 per cent of GoP's shares in OGDCL through public offering. Petroleum Division submitted that current per share value of OGDCL is far below the earlier offered divestment price of Rs.216 in 2014. They also expressed that \"being the Administrative Division of OGDCL they feel it incumbent to request that the PC review the ongoing process and not resort to selling the GoP's 7% share in OGDCL at this stage\". Petroleum Division proposed that: (i) given the current price of OGDCL 's share which is being traded at very low value, the ongoing divestment of GoP's 7% share in OGDCL may not be processed at this stage; and (ii) PC may consider that the transaction is structured in instead of 7% GoP's shareholding in OGDCL, GoP 's 10% shares, may be offered to a Strategic Investor Company, preferably to a well-versed oil & gas sector exploration and  development company which would bring best industry practices and knowledge, state of the art exploration and production technique in the larger interest of OGDCL and E&P sector in Pakistan.\" On August 21, 2020,   Ministry of Privatization apprised that OGDCL's share posted highest Rs.276 in December 2013 and post December 2014 has not exceeded Rs.200 mark. A closer look at the recent trend reflects a value of very high volatility with a low of Rs.77 at the end of quarter in March 2020 which was recently traded at around Rs. 115. PC Board in its meeting held on July 29, 2020 considered the proposal submitted by the Petroleum Division to attract investment from international E&P companies  in OGDCL by increasing the divestment of government owned shares upto 10 per cent instead of earlier decision of upto to 7 per cent. The Board was of the view that it will not be a viable option for the strategic E&P companies to acquire proposed percentage of shares in OGDCL, as still they would not be in a position to take strategic decisions. PC Board also observed that the shares of OGDCL are being traded at low price, as compared to the price prevailing at offerings in the past couple of years. The Board also gave due consideration to OGDCL's high dividend yield ratio, crude oil prices in international markets and a recent farming out decision by an international E&P company operating in Pakistan. The Board after due deliberations did not endorse the Petroleum Division's proposal to increase the divestment of shares from the earlier approved decision of CCoP upto 7 per cent and decided that divestment of OGDCL shares should not exceed this limit. The PC Board also directed the Transaction Committee to consider documented or undocumented mode for public offering at the time of hiring the FA. Furthermore, it was recommended by the PC Board that divestment of OGDCL and PPL transactions may be planned with reasonable in-between time to make them successful. The CCoP, in its meeting held on August 21, 2020 has directed Ministry of Privatization to go ahead with the process of divestment of up to 07 % of GOP's shares in OGDCL, after the divestment of PPL's shares as directed/recommended by the PC Board.

Therefore, considering the associated reservoir and volumetric uncertainties, M/s PPL has requested for 5.0 MMCFD gas allocation to third party from Dhok Sultan X-1 during the EWT period Ministry of Energy proposed that upto 5.0 MMCFD gas from Dhok Sultan X-1 may be allocated to MIS PPL for sale to third party through competitive bidding in a transparent manner during EWT period or till installation of processing plant and pipeline after which the processed gas would stand allocated to SNGPL to meet its deficit in gas supply and demand. Meanwhile, M/s PPL would initiate necessary arrangements for improving the quality of gas for formal allocation to M/s SNGPL and would ensure the completion of the required arrangements well before 28 months timeline.

The minister added that the latest discovery will also help revitalize the economy as foreign exchange reserves are disturbed by hefty LNG imports which as per the minister amount to $15-16 billion. As per details available, the discovery was made by the state-owned multinational petroleum company Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) back in December 2019. PPL recently achieved a historic milestone with the discovery of significant gas reserves from Morgandh X-1 in Margand Block, Balochistan on the Kalat plateau. Notably, this was the westernmost discovery in Pakistan, opening up a new sub-basin for future exploration. Further deepening up of Morgandh X-1 resulted in a longer gas bearing column of about one kilometre, indicating larger reserves potential than estimated earlier which will be firmed up based on appraisal wells. The discovered column of gas along with map indicates a volume close to one trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas. Back in December, PPL made first gas discovery on Balochistan's Kalat Plateau from exploratory well Margand X-1. The discovery opened a new sub-basin for further hydrocarbon exploration. Meanwhile, the latest will not only add to Pakistan\u2019s hydrocarbon reserves it will contribute in reducing the gap between supply and demand of oil and gas in the country through the exploitation of indigenous resources. With a portfolio of 48 exploration blocks and 59 fields and discoveries, PPL made a record number of 11 discoveries in one year during 2018-19 with a further two in 2019-20, achieving a reserves replacement ratio of 110percent.

Pakistan E&P sector is amongst the most profitable sectors in Pakistan wherein, the companies have operating margins of around 55 percent, EBITDA margins of 63 percent and net margins of 40 percent. Taking cue from listed companies, balance sheet position of E&P companies is also strong with no debt and strong cash balance. Nonetheless, state owned companies like OGDC and PPL have serious cash flows problems due to piling gas sector circular debt. Currently there are 24 operators working in Pakistan E&Ps space, out of which 14 are international and 10 are local. ENI major producing assets in Pakistan comprises of Bhit, Badhra and Kadanwari, which generates 75 percent of its revenue. \"We estimate, at $50 per barrel, ENI revenue from E&P assets at $105 million (or Rs 17.4 billion),\" Shankar Talreja at Topline Securities said, adding that the fields of the company like Bhit and Badhra are priced at Petroleum Policy 2001 (uncapped), Kadanwari is priced based on Furnace Oil, while Mitha is priced as per Petroleum Policy 2012. \"As per our estimates, over 90 percent of the revenues of ENI are coming from gas, for which we believe EV to reserve of Mari Petroleum will be well suited for valuation purpose,\" he said. Generally, one boe of gas fetches lower revenues (discount of over 50 percent) than one boe of oil/condensate, that's why application of sector EV/reserve of $2.24 would be misleading and inflationary, he said. Net remaining reserves of ENI (84mmboe) translate into total value of $94 million using EV/reserve of Mari. With industry's average, total value comes at around $189 million. Taking cue from the previous transactions, any premium above EV/reserves cannot be ruled out.

But while the country\u2019s power sector woes are much talked about, far less is debated about the natural gas sector despite it mirroring all the ills of power sector. For example, distribution losses in the Power Sector are approximately 18% (equivalent to Rs. 45 Billion per annum, over NEPRA allowance) which are twice that of international norm, whereas UFG equivalent of direct losses is 14% (Rs. 105 billion per annum, over and above OGRA allowance), which is 7 times that of international norm. Natural gas resources, which currently contribute 50% to Pakistan\u2019s total energy supply, are declining rapidly with no sizeable gas discoveries in sight in tandem with inefficient use of indigenous natural gas. As per Council of Common Interest (CCI), severe shortages of gas have been predicted in the coming years. A shortage of roughly 500 MMcfd is expected during the winters of 2020-2022, virtually shutting down the industry for 2 \u2013 3 months and severely contracting economic output. The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) prediction of a contraction of Pakistan\u2019s GDP by 0.40% in 2020 comes as no surprise. If economic growth is to become a national priority, the direct and indirect effects of the natural gas crisis must be assessed while simultaneously formulating a timely and efficient long-term action plan. This article is aimed at highlighting some of the sector\u2019s key challenges which would come to lie at the heart of such a reform agenda. Let us begin by analyzing demand and supply trends over the past few years as well as projections for the same. On the supply side, gas reserves have been on the decline in Pakistan (see Figure1) and very little exploration activities are taking place and are not likely reap benefits before at least 5 years. And while several natural gas fields have been discovered since mid-2015 and are being further examined for viability, no production timeline is scheduled yet. On the demand side both consumers and production sectors have contributed to a continuing and rapid rise. For instance, the addition of 0.5 million new consumers in 2018-19 will increase the gap in demand and supply, especially in winter, further aggravating gas load shedding and disputes over allocation. As evident, in the face of rising needs by consumers and businesses and declining reserves, supply is not sufficient to meet demand. Resultantly, severe shortages have emerged since 2007 and while they were initially confined to winters when there is a spike in gas use for heating purposes, the shortfall now extends all year round. As per World Bank (WB) estimates, gas shortages of nearly 1,800 MMcfd were witnessed in FY2015 (see Figure 2).  Given these grim circumstances, future outlook is no better as shortages are expected to rise to 3,684 MMcfd in the next five years (FY 2024-25) and to 5,389 MMCFD in the course of the next decade (FY 2029-30), as is evidenced in the projections provided in Table 1. To put things in perspective, the shortage is nearly three times the country\u2019s existing gas shortfall and at least a 100% additional required over current domestic production. A natural enquiry at this point then is the concoction of factors that have fueled gas shortages in recent years.  , the government\u2019s chronic inability to accurately assess demand as well as contain it over the years serves as a primary reason for shortages. This exponential rise over the last 3 decades in gas consumption can be attributed to at least two factors: (i) the government\u2019s shortsighted policies, planning and operations: a decade ago, when industries and automobiles shifted from oil to gas, policymakers failed to estimate the demand-supply gas arising from the shift, and (ii) the government\u2019s gas allocation and consumer gas pricing policy. These policies are (largely) discretionary and provide significant power to the decision-makers, creating avenues for vested interests and pressure groups to advocate and achieve their own goals. The current government is burdened with financial burden of Circular Debt amounting Rs. 350 billion contributed by SNGPL and SSGC by keeping low gas tariffs for maximum political gain \u2013 not passing the OGRA determined pricing (Under 2012 Petroleum Policy) to people \u2013 resulting in increased demand and consumption, or rather misuse of gas, and providing RLNG to domestic users. However, OGRA has taken some steps in rationalizing the tariffs including increasing of tariffs and lowering of unaccounted for gas (UFG) benchmarks. Although the heightened tariffs must look out for vulnerable and lifeline consumers that cannot afford the gas even at low pricing. A two-pronged solution to this lower tariff for lifeline and lower category users is that i) tariff must be set on a cost-of-service basis for an efficient and reliable gas sector, and ii) direct subsidy like BISP \u2013 an effective instrument \u2013 must be embedded to protect the poor household consumers. Gas prices in Pakistan are low and supplies inefficiently allocated, encouraging higher demands - the weighted-average purchase cost for wellhead gas was estimated at $3.50 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) for FY 2017, 10% higher than those in India and almost double than those in Bangladesh. This results in economic waste in terms of welfare loss where consumers are willing to pay more for steady supply of gas, and reduced profits for producers where they can charge higher prices. Moreover, the government implements a uniform gas price for each consumer category across the country regardless of the distance, volume, or cost of supply, further highlighting its inefficiency. Another area where the inefficiencies curtailing the resourceful development of gas sector is the overall revenue structure of both Sui companies where the sector is highly regulated with all aspects have been under one control and creating monopolies. The operations \u2013 pipeline, marketing, gas supply \u2013 are managed by SNGPL and SSGC, whereas deregulation of structure in separating the pipeline business from the sale business will eventually uplift the efficiency of complete supply chain. Since, the departments are highly politicized, all gas supply schemes are politically motivated including the gas exploration initiatives only a decade ago. There were roughly 22 foreign companies with vested interest for new avenues in upstream activities of Pakistan, are now left with only 3 - The management of upstream gas concessions have remained a bottleneck to increased gas supplies. Politically induced allocations and monopolistic business operations are all administrative bottlenecks that have handicapped foreign companies to reap the benefits of our resourceful land. A lot of basin studies have pitched Pakistan gas potential at roughly 10 times the reserves currently discovered. Realization of the yet to be discovered reserves depends upon concerted efforts, openness, a market-based pricing system and Progressive Petroleum Exploration Policy. We are confident that with modern techniques and a strong will, gas discoveries can boost availability of domestic gas in the medium term ~ 5 years by about 50% of current production. For this to happen, the monolithic OGDC and the lethargic PPL need to be shaken, and exploration needs to be reorganized on modern managerial and effective structures.  The wellhead prices are not the only factor for low exploration in Pakistan, there are other countries where the prices are even low but exploration are still taking place. Moreover, as stated earlier, the Division controls the entire structure, for example, one needs a permission for even well-commencement. This approach of holding all operations in one control is bound to create inadequacies costing welfare and economic loss. Without a strong effort to overcome this weakening of incentives, it is unlikely that exploration activity or gas production in Pakistan will recoup the trend observed up to 2005, i.e. 6 to 8 per cent increase in production per annum. , government irregularities in regulatory frameworks and policy formulation have also aggravated shortages. In the early 2000s, while facing acute gas shortages, the government put a rather poorly thought-out and counterproductive policy in place, prioritizing allocation to the commercial and residential sectors (paying below current average cost of supply) while putting fertilizer and power in second place. According to USAID estimates, however, the same gas would have provided great economic benefits had it been used for power generation. This realization came late for the government which later revised its gas allocation policy, only to ignore the merit order and supply gas to an inefficient, aging fleet of public plants resulting in gas wastages while more efficient plants continued to suspend production owing to acute shortages. The gas sector is laden with continuous implementation of poorly thought reforms and policies. A recent instance of the same is when OGRA decided to charge different tariff for RLNG and gas indicating both as separate products. Although, both RLNG and local gas are supplied mostly through the same network and metered through the same system but the latter is charged with lower UFG than the former despite the fact that RLNG is generally expensive and has lower actual loss. RLNG inducted into the system is mixed with indigenous gas coming from different sources is indistinguishable from other gas already in the system. Hence, there is no point in treating the same product as two and adding complexities in the already jumbled sector. Furthermore, the tariff for gas and electricity must be in sync and both sources must be treated as a commodity. Difference in pricing will eventually result in misallocation of resources and induce arbitrage opportunities. Variability in tariff creates disparity and hence must be kept in tandem by the regulator \u2013 and that too, should be same for both sources of energy. Furthermore, Pakistan\u2019s cost of power production is 26% higher for the industrial sector compared to other regional countries like Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Bangladesh, South Korea, Thailand and India, and it is 28% costlier for residential areas than the regional countries. To add to consumers\u2019 and investors\u2019 woes, inconsistent regulation between NEPRA and OGRA sends confused signals to consumers and investors, and creates disharmony in pricing strategies between gas and electricity. Additionally, since both are sources of energy, the variability in tariff on gas and electricity is $6.5/MMBTU (power generation at 40% costs approx. Rs. 10.5/Kwh) and \u20b59.0/kwh (Rs. 15/Kwh), creates opportunities for arbitrage in the system. Hence, the prices must be set in equilibrium at $6.5/MMBTU for gas and \u20b57.5/kwh for electricity as one of the measures in establishing an efficient system design.  , gas losses are a major drain in the system, causing acute shortages. It is estimated that Pakistan loses more than an eighth of gas during delivery and while many factors contribute to these high losses, the main ones can be traced to the ways in which SSGC and SNGPL are regulated, the institutions that manage most of the gas transmission and distribution in Pakistan.  No regulatory mechanism links their financial returns to their operational efficiency and tariff setting disproportionately rewards capital investment, encouraging firms to favour network expansion over pipeline maintenance. Both SSGCL and SNGPL have under-performed in managing distribution networks, leading to high levels of unaccounted for gas (UFG). UFG is typically 1\u20132 percent in OECD countries owing to better management and the larger share of bulk consumption in the consumer mix, whereas Pakistan\u2019s UFG (for July 2020) is 17.83% and 11.45% as estimated by SSGCL and SNGPL respectively. Moreover, underground leakage from aging pipelines and poor maintenance have contributed significantly to UFG in Pakistan. According to World Bank estimates, the average leakage rate is 4.9 leaks per KM for SSGC and 2.2 for SNGPL. By contrast, the same average is 0.22 in Germany and 0.36 in few states of the U.S. Needless to mention, another major area contributing to gas shortages is theft which accounted for 16.5% of total UFG in 2015, including 14% by unregistered users illegally drawing gas from pipelines and 3% by registered users tampering with meters. Moreover, SNGPL and SSGCL\u2019s \u2018saving technique\u2019 to conserve or reduce consumption by lowering pressure of natural gas during night hours is not only ineffective but also dangerous, extinguishing space heater and geysers resulting in fatal accidents. , and relatedly, the government\u2019s strategy to import LNG to address shortages is not a viable option and rather allows the problem to persist due to one simple reason:  . Lacking realization of this simple phenomenon, Pakistan\u2019s LNG imports continue to rise (see Table 2) e.g. they rose to 901 MMcfd during FY 2018-19 from 754 MMcfd in FY 2017-18, and their share in in overall natural gas supplies increased to 27% in FY 2018-19 from 24% the previous year.  , natural gas is used very inefficiently in Pakistan. This is partly because large quantities of appliances are produced by small-scale manufacturers that do not meet national or international standards of safety. Utilities that operate on commercial principles have to achieve acceptable standards of performance and management and/or their staff face actions when minimum performance standards are not met. Sadly, this is not the case in our country. Enforceability of standards on appliances for sale in the market can be ensured if regulation was brought about that any appliance that was to be connected to the system, must be approved for use by OGRA or any other body who may be assigned this task. So, with these perennial problems and chronic shortages plaguing the country\u2019s gas sector, what kind of future can we envision for ourselves? The Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL) predicts that Pakistan\u2019s indigenous oil reserves will be exhausted by 2025 and that the country will run out of domestic sources of natural gas by 2030. The sector-wise consumption of gas is provided in Figure 3 and Table 3. Given that more than half of existing gas reserves have already been exhausted while no noteworthy addition has been made to gas reserves in the last 17 years, and that the country now only has sufficient reserves to last just over 15 years in the best-case scenario where consumption is capped at present-day levels , the question is: what will become of all the consumers and businesses in this consumption mix? Does the government have any short- or long- term plans up its sleeve to save them from impending doom or all is bleak? Achieving the economic potential of energy efficiency is complex but Pakistan needs to start somewhere. According to ADB, being a developing economy means Pakistan still possesses high energy saving potential. It is currently 15% more energy intensive than India and 25% more intensive than Philippines in the Asian region, but reducing energy intensity can become a key priority to curb gas consumption and save it for peak hours to meet demand. An EY study concludes that Pakistan can benefit from measures with high potential energy saving such as (i) metering, (ii) thermal insulation of steam lines and valves (iii) tuning of boiler burners and improvement of the air-to-fuel ratio (iv) installation of heat recovery from exhaust flue gases (v) control of compressed air leakage, (vi) condensate recovery and (vii) heat recovery from wastewater, in energy intensive industries such as textile, sugar, paper and leather. The study also found that by adopting the aforesaid energy efficient practices, energy consumption in these industries in Pakistan could be reduced by a total of more than 3.7 million MWh annually. At the same time, increasing the energy efficiency of products can also provide a good starting point. Other South Asian countries like Bangladesh are already promoting efficient use of existing resources, both on the supply and demand side. Pakistan can learn much from their example and endeavour to maintain energy efficiency benchmarks at international standards to save gas and tackle shortages in short term. Under the existing circumstances, this seems to be the only way forward for Pakistan if it aims to resolve the perils and problems that have long plagued its gas sector.

While nothing of the sort has been reported so far, and no intimations have been made in the recent meeting of the two premiers, chances of Malaysian energy giant entering Pakistan have been voiced officially and unofficially. The government of Pakistan has invited Malaysian oil and gas companies to participate in the auction of 18 fresh oil and gas blocks being offered to foreign investors soon. A key contender here is Petronas, Malaysia\u2019s integrated oil and gas company fully owned by the government, which has also shown interest in the country energy sector previously. The company\u2019s chairman had visited Pakistan earlier in 2019 and shown interest in increasing Petronas footprints in the country\u2019s energy sector. Foreign investment in Pakistan\u2019s upstream oil and gas sector has been missing for reasons like policy hurdles and security situation in the country. Investment by a global leader in oil and gas like Petronas is much needed. But the name is not new to the market. Petronas had operation in Pakistan - starting in 1995 \u2013 but it exited the country in 2010-11 selling its entire oil and gas exploration and production assets to the Austrian company, OMV. This was likely the time when security, and low and order situation in the country had deteriorated to its worst. A few factors now point towards the likely return of the oil and gas giant into the country. One, the security situation in the country has improved considerably, which could a significant hurdle out of the way for investing in Pakistan. Second, government officials have been making offers and sending positive signals of Malaysian investment in the energy sector. PM\u2019s recent visit or Malaysia could further pave a pay for improved trade and investment between the two countries.\u00a0 The government has also reportedly shared the possibility of Petronas acquiring divested shares from OGDC, PPL, and Mari Petroleum. And third, the China-US tussle and now the Corona Virus outbreak is creating an opportunity for Pakistan to benefit from Petronas entry in the country\u2019s LNG market. Petronas has been targeting growing LNG demand in Asia as its long-term strategy with China taking a lion\u2019s share of the total LNG export from Malaysia. However, slower expected demand in China is likely to result in supply glut and US is also aggressively moving towards becoming a leading exporter of the fuel. A demand decline in China is likely to be compensated by Petronas making inroads in other Asian countries including Pakistan. Moreover, Petronas has been looking towards Pakistan\u2019s LNG market for some time now. The two countries are have also signed the Inter - Governmental Agreement in 2017 for the supply of LNG.

The highest court of the country, the Supreme Court of Pakistan and High Courts throughout the country grant stay of recovery in eligible cases even where the vires of any law are challenged on the touchstone of the supreme law of the land-Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan (\"the Constitution). \nIn view of the hierarchical character of the judicial system in Pakistan, it is of paramount importance that the law declared by courts should be certain, clear and consistent. Inconsistencies create distrust in the administration of justice. It is an established fact that most decisions of the courts are of significance, not merely because they constitute adjudication on rights of parties and resolve disputes between them, but a fortiori in doing so they embody a declaration of law, operating as a binding principle (stare decisis) in future cases. In this latter aspect lies their particular value in developing the jurisprudence of law and the same is true in the matter of granting stay of recovery in tax matters. In a large number of cases where the vires of section 80C, 80CC and 80D of the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979 were challenged, recoveries were stayed, though the matter was finally decided against taxpayers by the Supreme Court in the Elahi Cotton Mills Ltd. and others v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Finance, Islamabad [(1997) 76 TAX 5 (S.C.Pak). \nOn the issue of interim stay, in the case of the Tharparkar Sugar Mills Ltd. v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Revenue Division and Chairman, CBR, Islamabad and another [1996] 73 TAX 215 (H.C.Kar.), the Sindh High Court held: \".....once a petition in tax matters is admitted that ispo facto shows that the petitioner has made a prima facie case....interim stay may be granted.\"This principle is held in a number of cases related to various taxes and its compilation is done in 'Principles of Income Tax Laws'(fifth edition, 2018) and in many other books. The point worth noting is that principles laid down for granting stay of recovery in tax matters, decided by Supreme Court and High Courts, have binding force under Article 189 and 201 of the Constitution. \nThe Lahore High Court in case of E.M.E. Cooperative v. CIT (2004) 90 TAX 359 (H.C.Lah.) held that application for stay of recovery should be given due consideration, which is a binding injunction/directions for all subordinate courts/tribunals/authorities.

CIT, Faisalabad & another [(1993) 67 tax 233 (H.C.Lah.)], it was held: \n\"It is well-settled that stay order, unlike injunctions, operates from the moment, it is passed irrespective of the time of its communication....legally speaking, the communication of the stay order granted by this court is not relevant. Even if the Income Tax Officer was not aware of the stay order granted by this court, all the proceedings taken subsequent to it are nullity in the eye of law.\" \nThe Supreme Court of Pakistan and High Courts, in a number of cases held that recovery of demand without decision by an independent authority should not be made, meaning by that in eligible cases Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue and Customs Appellate Tribunal are under legal obligation to provide interim relief by way of stay before deciding the appeal if a prima facie case exists. The same principle will apply to provincial tax legislations. Some of the cases to this effect are: \n1. Mehram Ali and Others v. Federation of Pakistan and others PLD 1998 SC 1445 \n2. Sunrise Bottling Co. (Pvt.) Ltd v Federation of Pakistan and 4 others (2006) 94 TAX 140 (H.C. Lah.) \n3. Punjab Provincial Cooperative Bank Ltd, Lahore v DCIT 2002 PTD 2799 \n4. Dawood Textile Printing Industries (Pvt.) Ltd, Faisalabad v Federation of Pakistan and 4 others PTCL 2010 CL.460 \nIn the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 [hereinafter \"the Ordinance\"], the Commissioner Inland Revenue holding jurisdiction of the case may grant extension of time for payment of tax or allow the taxpayer to pay such tax in installments [section 128(1A)] though he seldom exercises these powers as meeting fixed targets/recovery is his/her main priority. Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) is also empowered to grant stay in income tax, sales tax and federal excise matters where appeals are filed. Collector (Appeals) is also empowered to grant stay under the Customs Act, 1969. In the Federal Excise Act, 2005 even the facility of automatic stay of six months is available in case 15 percent tax demand is paid along with appeal [proviso to section 37(3) of the Federal Excise Act, 2005]. \nFirst, appellate authorities, i.e., Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) or Collector (Appeals) are not considered as independent judicial forums as they are under administrative control of the Federal Board of Revenue(FBR) and can be transferred any time back to become part of field formation assigned the revenue collection targets. In the light of above case law, it is, therefore, imperative for the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue and Customs Appellate Tribunal to not only decide the appeals when filed before them but also adjudicate stay applications expeditiously on the basis of settled principles. \nThe rejection/refusal or stay with harsh conditions by first tax appellate authority also gives rise to application for stay before the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue and Customs Appellate Tribunal. In such cases, Tribunal may allow stay, waive harsh condition imposed by first appellate authority though appeals remain pending at first appeal level, or reject the same if no case is made out. \nWhere appeals and stay applications are filed simultaneously or stay applications afterwards when recovery is started, the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue and Customs Appellate Tribunal are under statutory duty to dispose of stay application before or with appeals expeditiously. The adjudication of application for stay independent of appeal is imperative, inter alia, for the following: \n* Legislature has provided statutory safeguard in section 131(5) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 [it equally applies to the Sales Tax Act 1990 by virtue of its section 46(2)] and section 194B of the Customs Act, 1969 so that the citizens/taxpayers are not put into undue jeopardy/difficulties till the final adjudication. \n* Tax departments should not use coercive measures for recovery before appeal is decided by an independent forum that is Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue and Customs Appellate Tribunal as it is the command of higher courts. In case the departments adopt such measures, the tribunals have to grant stay strictly in accordance with law/rules and principles settled by higher courts. \n* In cases where the impugned orders are prima facie unlawful, arbitrary, excessive, and/or unfair, Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue and Customs Appellate Tribunal are empowered, rather duty-bound, to grant relief after the aggrieved person makes out a case for unconditional and/or conditional stay after affording an opportunity to the department. \nThe above parameters are not exhaustive. They are only recommendatory in nature. The 'trinity' of prima facie case, financial stringency and balance of convenience is the basic tenet which is indispensable in consideration of a stay application independent of a pending appeal or even it is not filed, e.g., in cases where first appellate authority declines the stay or allows it with unreasonable conditions. \nSince tax tribunals are first independent judicial forums, it is necessary to discuss stay proceedings at this level in detail. In this respect, it is imperative to reproduce section 131(5) of the Ordinance to accentuate this point [almost the same position exists in Second Proviso to section 194B of the Customs Act, 1969]. It reads as under: \n(5) Notwithstanding that an appeal has been filed under this section, tax shall, unless recovery thereof has been stayed by the Appellate Tribunal, be payable in accordance with the assessment made in the case. \nProvided that if on filing of application in a particular case, the Appellate Tribunal is of the opinion that the recovery of tax levied under this Ordinance and upheld by the Commissioner (Appeals), shall cause undue hardship to the taxpayer, the Tribunal, after affording opportunity of being heard to the Commissioner, may stay the recovery of such tax for a period not exceeding one hundred and eighty days in aggregate: \nProvided further that where recovery of tax has been stayed under this section, such stay order shall cease to have effect on expiration of the said period of 180 days following the date on which the stay order was made and the Commissioner shall proceed to recover the said tax: \nProvided further that in computing the aforesaid period of one hundred and eighty days, the period, if any, for which the recovery of tax was stayed by a High Court, shall be excluded. \nIt is abundantly clear from plain language of section 131(5) of the Ordinance that appeal and stay application are two distinguishable acts. Notwithstanding that an appeal under section 131 of the Ordinance has been filed, Department can resort to recovery of disputed tax unless stay is granted by Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue. A conjunct reading of section 130, 131(5) and Proviso(s) added to it by the Finance Act, 2009 and subsequently substituted by the Finance Act, 2012 enunciate as under: \n1. On filing of application for stay in any case, where appeal is pending in Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue, order for granting stay or refusing it has to be passed independent of decision in appeal. \n2. Stay is to be granted after affording opportunity of being heard to the Commissioner Inland Revenue. \n3. Statutory period of stay is prescribed by Legislature and on expiry it stands vacated. \nIn a recent decision of the Division Bench of Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue in MA (Stay) No. 611/PB/2019 in ITA No. 413/PB/2019 (Tax year 2017) dated 15.11.2019 followed in MA (Stay) STA No. 1153/IB/2019 dated 19.11.2019, it is held asunder: \n\"...it is our humble view that the entrustment of the main appeal prior to fixation of the stay application to the Bench is necessary for the reason that if the Bench does not hear the main appeal then how it can hear and decide only the stay application which is ancillary to the proceedings. Interim relief is the part of main appeal and it is immutable principle of law which cannot be lightly brushed aside that where a Court is competent to allow final relief, it has also got the jurisdiction to allow interim relief. Reliance may be placed on the judgment report as Additional Collector-II Sales Tax, Lahore Vs M/s Abdullah Sugar Mills Ltd (2003 SCMR 1026). By following this principle it is essential to entrust the appeal and application simultaneously to the Bench and after that the said Bench shall hear and decide the matter. If this principle is not followed and the appeal is entrusted to one Bench and stay application to another Bench then the aforesaid principle of law would be violated which is not permissible in any cannon of interpretation. Further this kind of procedure may create difference of opinion amongst the Benches. For instance the Bench has granted the stay to the taxpayer and subsequently the application for extension in stay is filed by the same taxpayer on the same issue but fixed to another Bench, it may create difference of opinion between the Benches. Therefore, to avoid such anomaly it would be appropriate to fix all the applications to the concerned Bench having been already entrusted the main appeal by the competent authority.\" \nThe Full Bench of Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue has overruled the above judgement [in MA (Stay) STA No.1153/IB/2019 in STA No.328/IB/2019] and paragraph 10 of its order dated January 8, 2020 reads as follows: \nThe Sub-section (5) of Section 131 and its proviso are of paramount importance to resolve this controversy, which was inserted by Finance Act, 2003 dated June 17, 2003 while the proviso 3 was substituted by Finance Act, 2012. A bare reading of sub-section (5) reveals that preferring of appeal and filing of stay application are two independent and separate proceedings. Sub-section (5) of Section 131 starts with clause which means that sub-section precludes whether appeals has been filed by the taxpayer is recovery proceedings can be stayed by the Appellate Tribunal otherwise tax shall be payable in accordance with the assessment made in the case. First proviso to this sub-section also supports this point of view which clearly provides that on filing of application in a number of cases, the Appellate Tribunal is of the opinion that the recovery of tax levied under this Ordinance which has been upheld by the Commissioner (Appeals) causes undue hardship to the taxpayer. The Tribunal after affording proper opportunity of being heard to the parties may stay the recovery of such tax for a period not exceeding 180 days in aggregate. From this proviso it can safely be inferred that application for recovery of tax is to be heard separately and independently provided the conditions as laid in the first proviso of sub-section (5) of this Section are fulfilled. Firstly, application for stay of recovery is filed, secondly, Commissioner (Appeals) has refused to grant stay of recovery, thirdly, the appellate tribunal is of the opinion that the tax levied shall cause undue hardship to the taxpayer and fourthly opportunity of being heard shall be provided to both parties. Thus, if sub-section (5) of Section 131 of the Ordinance is read with all its three provisos, the conclusion is very obvious that the Appellate Tribunal may grant or refused to grant the stay of recovery of tax irrespective of the fact that the appeal has been filed by the taxpayer. \nThe arguments advanced by the Division Bench of Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue in MA (Stay) No.611/PB/2019 in ITA No.413/PB/2019 (Tax year 2017) dated 15.11.2019 [followed in MA (Stay) STA No.1153/IB/2019 dated 19.11.2019] now overruled and para 10 reproduced above of Full Bench of Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue elicited arguments amongst legal fraternity in favour and against the decisions. This issue, therefore, needs further elaboration for debate and discourse. \n(The writers, lawyers and partners in Huzaima, Ikram & Ijaz, are member Adjunct Faculty of Lahore University of Management Sciences) ", "name": "ppl"}, {"count": 319, "date": "July 27, 2020", "url": "https://www.brecorder.com/news/40007933/pol-awards-hindko-language-books", "article": "PESHAWAR: Two books published by the Gandhara Hindko Academy have won literary awards from the Pakistan Academy of Letters for the year 2018. The awarded publications are a Hindko language poetry book, \"Peepal Watrey\" and novel titled \"Shaam-e-Alam\". The first book is of poetry by a noted Hindko, Urdu poet and lyricist from Peshawar city, Syed Saeed Gillani. The second one is by Nazeer Bhatti, a senior writer who has to his credit several books, television plays and film stories. The publication has been penned to highlight the Qissa Khwani massacre committed by the British Colonial forces on April 23, 1930 in Peshawar by opening fire on the citizens which led to a number of casualties. The incident is an important part of the Independence Movement. It may be mentioned here that the Pakistan Academy of Letters has also awarded in the past the Hindko language books published by the Gandhara Hindko Academy. The books awarded were \"Pathar Daa Jigar\" by Aftab Iqbal Bano, a Canada-based accomplished writer from Peshawar, and \"Hasanat Jamee-o-Khisalahi\" by Professor Hussam Hur who, too, is from the walled city.  \"Ghazwaat-e-Nabvi\" (Peace be upon Him)\", a book by Professor Malik Nasir Daud of Hazara Division, was honoured with the prestigious Seerat Award. Other literary bodies such as Abaseen Arts Council, Pakistan Writers Guild, etc, have honoured as well the books and publications brought out by the Gandhara Hindko Academy. It is worth mentioning that Gandhara Hindko Academy has been working since 2015 AD in Peshawar for the promotion of Hindko and other Pakistani languages and cultures associated with them. The Gandhara Hindko Board, a vibrant literary and cultural organization headed by a former senior civil officer and chief secretary of KP and Sindh, Ejaz Ahmad Qureshi, runs the academy under the Public-Private Partnership. A noted Hindko writer, poet and research scholar, Muhammad Ziauddin, is the chief of the executive committee which plans and executes all the activities of the academy in consultation with other members. As per the last population census, Hindko is the sixth main regional language of Pakistan, others being Punjabi, Pashto, Sindhi, Saraiki, Balochi and Brahvi. It is spoken in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, parts of northern Punjab and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.

In his opening remarks, Chairman, Board of Directors, PPL Shahab Rizvi highlighted that despite the global recession owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, PPL delivered a robust performance during 2020-21. The Board remained fully committed and engaged in governance and oversight of the Company's strategy and operations. # He thanked all stakeholders along with the Company's staff for their perseverance and commitment to deliver in these challenging times. For his part, MD and CEO PPL, Moin Raza Khan highlighted that even though the COVID-19 global pandemic adversely affected businesses, the Company has shown remarkable resilience, while operating under the looming shadow of this pandemic for almost two years, by managing to not only deliver uninterrupted energy to the national grid but also achieving a historic milestone of winning an exploration block in Abu Dhabi Bid Round. \"PPL led a consortium of 'big four' national E&P companies to secure the country's first-ever concession in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates,\" he added. \"Alhamdulillah, PPL has earned the 2nd highest profit-after-tax in its history. We have also managed to improve collections from our customers, amid aggravating circular debt in the country, through highest-level engagement with them,\" Khan noted. PPL's daily production share stood around 852 MMscfd gas equivalents during 2020-21, a decrease from the previous year due to significantly lower off-take by GENCO II from Kandhkot. Nonetheless, the Company achieved a reserves replacement ratio of 108 percent with effective field development activities. Production commenced from Benari X-1, Shah Bandar Block and Hadaf X-1 as well as commissioning of GPF- IV Phase II, Gambat South that collectively added 35 MMscfd gas to the supply network. Besides, PPL drilled seven development wells-three in operated and four in partner-operated fields. The Company is geared to enhance its production share through commissioning of Dhok Sultan Oil Handling and Zafir Processing facilities in the near future together with optimizing production from mature fields. The Company's exploration efforts remained focused on reserve replenishment through exploratory drilling in conventional and frontier areas. Six exploratory wells - three each in operated and partner-operated areas - were drilled. Besides Balochistan, the Company is targeting a new frontier play in Sindh at Khipro East X-1, Khipro East Block. With this, a discovery Mamikhel South-1 was made in partner-operated Tal Block. Talking about PPL's diversification strategy aimed at de-risking revenue streams against the backdrop of escalating circular debt - Khan shared that Baryte, Lead and Zinc project has made considerable headway and slated to be executed soon through PPL's mining arm, Bolan Mining Enterprises, a joint venture between PPL and Government of Balochistan.

Regarding the capacity and capability of CPGCL gas offtakes, this has been in very active discussion at the very top levels between the Petroleum and Power Divisions since early last year. As per the SAPM directives at that time a 24 hour deliverability test was arranged in 2020 by MoE. The results of the test were presented in a meeting attended by all stakeholders including SAPM-PD which clearly indicated the incapacity of CPGCL to take the contractual gas volume (250 mmcfd) and directed CPGCL to release spare gas above 150 mmcfd. This was the decision at that time, however, the situation has become far more grave, as the average offtake per year since 2019 till today speaks for itself. According to the letter, minutes of the meeting held on February 24, 2021 which was attended by Minister of Energy and SAPMs of both Petroleum and Power Divisions, clearly recorded that \u201cSAPM on Power was of the view that old units of Genco-II are to be decommissioned by 1\u00bd year time and thus Genco-l cannot withhold excess gas allocation which can be utilized for other economic activity.\u201d He emphasized that Power Division must examine the requirement of gas considering seasonal effect and utilization capacity. Secretary, Power Division endorsed the viewpoint of SAPM on Petroleum and SAPM on Power and sought a week\u2019s time to revert. The representative of PPL informed that it has been consistently reporting underutilization of Kandhkot gas by Genco-Il and re-allocation of up to 100 mmcfd gas to any other buyer. PPL\u2019s representative informed that PPL can provide additional gas in national network in winter of 2021 provided decision of gas volumes is made as soon as possible. It was further stated that in case of emergency or short- term need, additional gas can be provided on an \u201cas available\u201d basis, after release of this 100 mmcfd. CPGCL in its letter of July 2, 2021 also referred CCoE decision according to which the old units of CPGCL are recommended for permanent shutdown. \u201cWe understand that Genco\u2019s two 747 units have good efficiency as compared to other units which is the prime reason for underutilization of the Genco\u2019s production capacity in the presence of other inefficient units. The maximum gas-offtakes of these units together is not more than 150 mmcfd,\u201d he added. PPL also informed that GSA agreed and signed between CPGCL and PPL is for gas offtakes of 200 mmcfd, accordingly Take-or-Pay amount 145 mmcfd (72.5% of 200 mmcfd). The clause 6 of the GSA stipulates that \u201cthe rate of ACQ after first three twelve months\u2019 period for the remaining period will be reviewed and decided by the parties with mutual consent keeping in view the Kandhkot gas field reservoir behavior and study.\u201d PPL KGF has already initiated request to CPGCL for a meeting for which reply from CPGCL is still awaited. SAPM on Power and Petroleum Division has suggested the Power Division to spare 100 mmcfd surplus volume from Kandhkot. In this regard, DG-Gas has requested Power Division for its consent on May 4, 2021. In view of above, PPL once again has reiterated that Genco-II is and will not be able to take the maximum gas offtakes from KGF as: (i) it is evident from the historical record of gas offtakes; and(ii) its 747 unit is going to be sold to a third party soon, hence, following ToRs are suggested that constitute a committee with members from Petroleum and Power Division including PPL and CPGCL, to review relevant correspondences, minutes of meeting, last two years and current offtakes data, Kandhkot field deliverability test run data, evaluate Genco\u2019s machines health and the CCoE decision. This would mean reviewing everything in historical perspective instead of going back to square one and starting all over again. The time is of essence, as the nation is starved of gas, and \u201cwe are compelled to import very expensive LNG, while PPL has the capacity to produce 125 mmcfd gas from Kandhkot Gas Field, on the basis of historically low gas offtake by Genco.\u201d The committee will recommend allocation of surplus gas volume to any other buyer based on the review/assessment.

A sub-committee of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) meeting was held under convener Syed Naveed Qamar to examine the audit reports of the OGDCL for the year 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19. While examining an audit para relating to wasteful expenditure of Rs988 million on procurement of amine unit for Sinjhoro, the committee members learnt that a mine unit plant procured for Euro 6.272 million for Sinjhoro field for sweetening of natural gas was lying unutilised since 2014.  Purchase of plant was based on a study conducted by the consultant, M/s ENAR, who later conducted another study, wherein, significant financial benefits were forecasted on installation of a redundant equipment i.e Skid Membrane lying at Qadirabad site.  Thereafter, Skid Membrane was installed on site and installation of amine unit was dropped. The management stated that the study carried out by consultant, M/s ENAR, recommended utilisation of available Membrane of Qadirpur at Singhoro and amine unit for Soghari. The convener of the committee remarked that M/s ENAR was \u201cnotorious\u201d for over-procurement during his period as the petroleum minister as well and their assessments were \u201cfaulty\u201d in various cases.  The managing director OGDCL said that the company was trying to sell the plant to Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) or it would be utilised in other recoveries where oxygen levels would be above six to seven percent. In another audit para relating to loss due to ill-planned procurement of Rs65.8 million for Soghari Field, the convener committee said the audit reports were indicating that the company needed better planning with accurate assessment of data for future procurements. In yet another case, the audit official said funds were blocked due to unnecessary procurement of inventory items of Rs50 million.  The managing director OGDCL said that out of all items only two ball valves were unutilised, which would be used in future. Referring to an audit objection of demurrage charges of Rs27 million, an official of the OGDCL informed the committee that the company had procured equipments worth Rs25 billion annually.  While examining an audit para of irregular purchase of second hand fire lorry of Rs20 million, the convener remarked that the company always concluded inquiries only after the retirement or death of responsible people.  He further said under the Companies Act, the company had the authority to hold inquiry of their employees under services rules but it should be conducted in national interest and the findings should be shared with the ministry.

Of the four listed E&P giants, OGDCL led in revenue as well as earnings growth (3 and 9 percent, respectively). The sluggishness in revenues was primarily due to weak production volumes of natural gas with some recovery in crude oil production. Where OGDCL witnessed some recovery in its crude oil production which climbed by 2.3 percent year-on-year, it\u2019s natural gas production on average fell by 2.6 percent year-on-year in FY21. For PPL, crude oil production climbed by 3 percent year-on-year, and natural gas production declined by around 4 percent in FY21. POL\u2019s oil and gas production fell by one and three percent, year-on-year, respectively. However, Mari Petroleum saw a 17 and 8 percent rise in its oil and gas production during the year.   On the expenses side, the largest overhead: exploration and prospecting expenditure remained on the lower side, declining year-on-year in some cases and remaining flattish for others. Slower growth in exploration costs should technically support the bottomline, but it could also mean lower drilling activity. Exploration costs usually entail the cost of dry and abandoned wells - a decline of which year-on-year means that a lesser number of wells were declared dry compared to the previous period; but it could also show that fewer attempts were made or that overall recoverable reserves are declining.   Overall, the E&P sector\u2019s profitability was among key sector performance on the stock market. The sector performed well in the last quarter of FY21 due to a surge of over 150 percent in crude oil prices year-on-year as well as an increase in oil and gas production, which also supported the overall FY21 performance.

Prime Minister Imran Khan rejected the summary of Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) for increasing petroleum prices. Special Assistant to the Prime Minister of Pakistan on Political Communication Dr Shahbaz Gill in a tweet on Sunday informed that the prime minister did not approve the proposed increase in the prices of the petroleum products. He announced that there was no increase in the prices despite the continuous surge in the prices in the global oil market. The regulator revised its mechanism for fixing of prices of petroleum products while recommended the increase to federal government in fortnight review. The regulator worked out prices of petroleum products based on notified petroleum levy (PL) at current fortnight instead of Rs 30 per litre and standard rates of general sale tax (GST) at 17 percent from March 1, 2021. The regulator had proposed Rs 6.22 per litre increase in the price of petrol. An increase in the price of high speed diesel (HSD) had recommended Rs 6.82 per litre. The price of kerosene oil (SKO) had recommended to raise by Rs 6.37 per litre and an increase in light diesel oil (LDO) by Rs 5.78 per litre. The prices of crude oil globally have gone up by $3.63 per barrel from $63.25 per barrel on February 16 to $66.88 per barrel on February 26, 2021. At present, the PL on per litre petrol is Rs17.97 and Rs18.36 levy on per litre HSD. These petroleum products are the major source of revenue collection of federal government. The prices are maintained at February level as government adjusted PL and ex-refinery prices of petroleum products. The government has already achieved 60 percent of budgeted Rs450 billion in the current financial year from the PL by keeping the rate at the highest level. Federal government has adjusted the hike in oil prices in PL by slashing the rate by Rs 5.32 per litre from Rs 17.97 to Rs 12.65 per litre for petrol. The rate of sale tax remains the same Rs 16.26 per litre. The ex-refinery rate/ cost of supply of PSO has increased by Rs 5.28 per litre from Rs 67.34 to Rs 72.62 per litre on petrol. The rate of PL on HSD also reduced to Rs 12.53 per litre. The PL rate for HOBC has been kept at Rs 30 per litre. Whereas, PL rate on kerosene oil and LDO have been kept zero.

Sheikh entered the Pakistani political arena during the dictatorship of Pervez Musharraf. From 2000 to 2002, he was Sindh\u2019s Finance Minister. In 2003 he won a PML-Q Senate seat, referred to as the \u2018king\u2019s party\u2019, and was promptly appointed as Minister for Privatization which he left in 2006 amidst considerable accolades as the country witnessed the largest-ever privatisation in its history during this period. It was speculated at the time that his departure was due to serious differences with the then prime minister Shaukat Aziz who privately expressed his reservations at Sheikh\u2019s ambition to replace him as the country\u2019s finance minister \u2013 the only portfolio that General Musharraf reportedly allowed Aziz to lord over. The Privatisation Commission (created on 22 January 1991) provided the following figures on its website of transactions carried out between April 2003 when Sheikh was appointed and December 2006: (i) Banks \u2013 51 percent of Habib Bank shares sold for 22,409 million rupees to Agha Khan Fund for Economic Development in December 2003; (ii) 9 capital market transactions through stock exchange to the general public including third offer of NBP (604 million rupees) in November 2003, OGDCL 5 percent share sale netting 6851 million rupees in November 2003 with two more transactions in December 2006 (the first netting 44,893 million rupees with the GDR offering to international institutions and 0.5 percent share sale of OGDCL with GDR offering to domestic institutions netting 2070 million rupees); 10 percent of SSGC shares in February 2004 for 1734 million rupees, 5.8 percent PIA shares for 1215 million rupees, PPL 15 percent shares in July 2004 netting 5633 million rupees, UBL 4.2 percent shares netting the government 1087 million share, and KAPCO 20 percent shares for 4815 million rupees, on April 2005; (iii) energy sector 51 percent shares in NRL sold to Attock Refinery and 73 percent shares to Hassan Associates in May and November 2005 netting a total of 32,275 million rupees; (iv) telecommunications - 26 percent shares of PTCL to Etisalat in July 05 at 155,992 million rupees and carrier telephone industries to Siemens Pakistan Engineering on October 2005 for 500 million rupees; (v) three cement plants \u2013 Dandot and Kohat Cement (10 percent additional shares from what was sold in 1992) to EMG, Mustekham Cement netted 3205 million rupees sold to Bestway cement and Javedan cement company limited sold to Haji Ghani Usman group in August 2006 at 4316 million rupees; (vi) chemicals - Khurram chemicals additional 10 percent sold to Pfizer Pakistan for 6 million in October 2003 and Ittehad chemicals 10 percent additional shares sold to EMG for 26 million rupees October 2004; (vii) Pak Arab fertilizer 94.8 percent shares sold to Export Reliance consortium for 14,126 million rupees on May 2005 and Pak American fertilizers sold for 280 million rupees to Azgard 9 in July 2006; (viii) Ghee - Kohinoor mills sold for 81 million rupees to Iqbal Khan in May 2004 and United Industries Limited sold to Akbar Magoo for 8 million rupees in September 2005; (ix) industrial units - Bolan Textiles sold to Sadaf Enterprises for 128 million rupees October 2005 and Lasbella Textile Mills sold to Raees Ahmed for 156 million rupees in November 2006; and (x) international advertising sold to EMG in April 2005 for 5 million rupees and Falettis hotel sold for 1211 million rupees to 4 B Marketing. Five observations are in order which may compel one to conclude that the privatization policy during Hafeez Sheikh\u2019s tenure as Privatization Minister was perhaps not an unqualified success. First, Shaukat Aziz, not a qualified economist, took full credit for the privatization policy during Musharraf\u2019s entire tenure however one would be hard pressed to agree with his claims. Second, balance sheets of the privatized companies at the time are no longer available to determine whether they were running into losses or profits at the time (though the consensus is that most if not all were profitable) and if so whether the Privatization Commission bothered to undertake a cost benefit analysis with the cost inclusive of foregone government profits for the next five years. Third, if one takes the Etisalat transaction out of the equation (155,992 million rupees) then total privatization proceeds during Hafeez Sheikh\u2019s tenure as the country\u2019s Privatization Minister amounted to 100,674 million rupees i.e. if December 2006 transactions when he had already resigned are not taken into account. Fourth, the names of some strategic investors/buyers crop up more than once with allegations against Sheikh that he favoured some over others where strategic investors were preferred and that he continued his support during his more recent stint as finance minister though without any investigation the allegations, like those hurled against some members of the opposition remain unsubstantiated. And finally, there has been no evaluation as to the success or otherwise of the privatised companies though Etisalat has yet to clear 800 million dollars and the sale of K-Electric is widely regarded as a failure due to its appallingly poor delivery and the continuation of government subsidies. In March 2010, after Shaukat Tarin\u2019s resignation the Zardari-led Pakistan People\u2019s Party, with a dearth of economists within its ranks, chose Hafeez Sheikh as the finance minister in 2010, a position he held till 2013. His tenure began with a failure to honour the pledges made by his predecessor to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on tax and power sector reforms leading to the suspension of the Fund programme with two tranches remaining. Sheikh\u2019s resignation was prompted reportedly by President Zardari\u2019s offer to nominate him as the country\u2019s caretaker prime minister which was unmet; after he left the country he laid the blame for placing the country on the path to yet another IMF programme by end 2012 on President Zardari. Imran Khan\u2019s selection of Hafeez Sheikh and a dismissal of his own long time loyalist Asad Umar from the finance portfolio was seen by his critics as indicative of establishment support, though in all probability Khan was stumped on who to appoint after he had reportedly reached the conclusion (which he admitted more than a year later) that his biggest mistake was in not going on a Fund programme soon after he took oath as the country\u2019s prime minister \u2013 a volte face from what he and Asad Umar had maintained before taking oath. During Sheikh\u2019s two stints as the country\u2019s de facto finance minister - March 2010 to February 2013 and 20 April 2019 to 29 March 2021 - he took the country back to the policies from before especially with respect to the eighteenth constitutional amendment and the National Finance Commission award which led the Fund to state in its press release dated 12 May 2019 that \u201cto improve fiscal management the authorities will engage provincial governments on exploring options to rebalance current arrangements in the context of the forthcoming National Financial Commission\u201d. What was more disturbing was Sheikh\u2019s denial during his media interactions and to parliament that he had reached an agreement with the Fund on the matter. If Shaukat Tarin becomes the de facto finance minister it bears reminding that as the architect of the last NFC award he is unlikely to make the same mistake as he has remained focused on a steady rise in revenue as per the NFC award \u2013 one percent rise as a percentage of GDP every year to meet the centre\u2019s financial needs. Sheikh\u2019s economics if not entirely shaped by international donor agencies (domestic debt rose from 16.5 trillion in August 2018 to 23.7 trillion rupees in September 2020) were certainly influenced by them and together with monetary policy decisions taken by the State Bank of Pakistan are responsible for the containment of the growth rate to 1.5 percent last year (pre-Covid-19). In addition, his failure to understand that the influence peddlers in the country would resist the Fund sponsored tax and power sector reforms making it impossible to achieve his unrealistic revenue targets within one year, is inexplicable as he faced somewhat a similar situation in 2010. Timing and phasing of the Fund programme was simply not appropriate, as stated by Shaukat Train in a recent interview. Tarin has always maintained that he resigned in 2010 because of personal reasons yet many of his close associates maintain that he resigned because the Zardari government refused to implement the necessary tax and power sector reforms. Imran Khan should be reminded that Shaukat Tarin took on the entire PPP cabinet during his previous tenure by insisting on third party audit of rental power projects \u2013 a decision that stood the country in good stead. To conclude, one would hope that the country\u2019s power centres \u2013 political and non-political \u2013 understand that degrees from a good university abroad and/or experience in international donor agencies do not guarantee an individual\u2019s ability to think out of the box or a capacity to compel his cabinet colleagues to deliver on reforms. One can only hope that this is a final farewell to Hafeez Sheikh.

The resolution strongly rejected India\u2019s \u201cillegal and unilateral actions\u201d of August 5, 2019, saying those were in direct violations of the UN Security Council resolutions and are aimed at changing the demographic structure of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu Kashmir (IIOJK), \u201csuppressing the realisation of the inalienable right to self-determination of Kashmiris as well as violating their civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights\u201d. Condemning Indian atrocities including extra judicial killings and demolition of homes and private properties as a form of collective punishment in the occupied valley, the resolution deplored change in the status of Urdu language associated with Kashmiri Muslims and their identity. It demanded resolution of Kashmir dispute in accordance with the aspirations of Kashmiri people and the UNSC resolutions.

Thus, in the new framework agreement, Barrick Gold of Canada will continue to own 50 percent stake in the project while the remaining 25 percent will be owned by government of Balochistan.  The total cost of the project is estimated to be around $10 billion which is likely to be completed over a period of 5-6 years, once the process of legislation is approved, according to CEO of Barrick Gold. Though the details of the settlement agreement have yet to be revealed, there are reports that the out of court settlement is contingent upon the penalty of $900 million which will be disbursed to previous company Antofagasta, Farhan Mahmood at Sherman Securities said. In the notifications by OGDC and PPL, it seems that the penalty would be paid by the federal government via these three SOEs, he added. \u201cWe believe that this amount will be paid upfront while the remaining contribution will be invested over a period of 5-6 years,\u201d Farhan Mahmood said. Unlike previous agreements on Reko Diq, it seems that the new framework will be passed through the parliament and Supreme Court since both provincial and federal government enjoy higher share in the project (combined stake of 50 percent) against earlier share of 25 percent. Previously, it was feared that the net dollar inflows via copper-gold exports may be marginal due to thin stake by government of Pakistan. According to various sources, Pakistan has 5.9 billion tons of copper and 4.1 million ounces of gold reserves. However, inferred reserves (according to SMEC) would be around 12.3 million tons of copper and 20.9 million ounces of gold. \u201cWe believe that final reserve studies will be carried out by Barrick Gold which is the main operator of the mining project,\u201d he said. Considering the track records of the mining companies, they usually operate at 10-20 percent production ratio against their inferred reserve size. Based on inferred size of copper-gold reserves and lower production ratio of 3.0 percent, it is estimated that $5.0 billion worth of copper-gold seems to be logical target for the project companies in initial phase (against total copper-gold reserve size of over $150 billion at current price) which will largely be exported and benefit Pakistan through dollar inflows. The expedition is new for Pakistan and there is no proper study on local copper-gold mining and thus, no benchmark available, Farhan Mahmood said. However, considering the recent financial report by Barrick Gold, the operator has been in this field quite a long time and recent numbers revealed that the gold mining is a profitable business since company posted EBITDA margin of 61 percent in 2021 while gross margin was close to 41 percent, he added. For local E&Ps, though margins are currently higher in oil and gas business, but given volatility in international oil prices, circular debt risk and declining production, the mining venture seems more profitable in the longer run, he said. \u201cOur back of the envelope working suggest that if the project is able to extract only 3.0 percent of the inferred copper-gold reserve, OGDC\u2019s and PPL\u2019s earnings would improve by around Rs15 billion each on net basis i.e. after taking account opportunity cost (pre-tax EPS impact OGDC Rs4.0, PPL Rs 6.0 at current price of gold and copper),\u201d he said adding that this may re-rate long-term stock valuation of both the entities. \u201cHowever, OGDC and PPL share of investment would be around Rs30 billion each on an annualised basis which we believe would be easily invested if the government ensures raising local gas prices which will help in curtailing circular debt and liquidity issues. OGDC, in material information sent to PSX said that the board of directors of the Company has, on the basis of directions issued by the Federal Government, resolved to enter into a non-binding framework agreement with: the President of Islamic Republic of Pakistan on behalf of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the Governor Balochistan on behalf of the province of Balochistan, Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL), Government Holding (Private) Limited (GHPL) and Barrick Gold Corporation, which sets out inter alia the ownership/transaction structure, rights, obligations and common objectives of the parties towards facilitating the implementation of the reconstitution of a joint mining project at Reko Diq, on an expedited basis (the Project). Through the Framework Agreement, the Company has, in principle, agreed to participate in 8.33 percent equity (which may be held through onshore or offshore holding companies) along with PPL GHPL, in aggregate amounting to 25 percent of equity in the Project divided equally amongst the Company, PPL and GHPL. 50 percent of the equity will be held by Barrick who shall also have management and operator rights and remaining 25 percent of the equity will be held by the Government of Balochistan directly and/or through any of its owned entity, of which 10 percent shall be free carry of the Government of Balochistan, the material information said. To the extent of agreed initial entry fee attributable to the Company, the Company has, on the basis of directions issued by the Federal Cabinet, agreed to support the Government of Pakistan (through cash collateral, contribution of funds or availing such other funded or unfunded facilities) with respect to payment obligations of the Government of Pakistan in respect of settlement of the historic Reko Diq dispute, it said. The Company\u2019s participation in the Project remains subject to, inter alia, receipt of internal and corporate approvals, regulatory approvals, execution of definitive long form agreements and other conditions precedent agreed in the Framework Agreement, it added. \u201cThe Company shall continue to notify the Pakistan Stock Exchange / Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan of any material information or developments that may arise with respect to the Company\u2019s participation in the Project,\u201d OGDC said.

However, since May 2022, KE has started to default in making timely payments to SSGC against weekly RLNG bills.   DG (Gas), Abdul Rasheed Jokhio, in a letter to Secretary Power Division, stated that due to financial constraints owing to delay in payment of RLNG bills by KE and in order to meet commitments with SNGPL, SSGC proceeded with encashment of bank guarantee provided by KE as Security Deposit to mitigate adverse financial implications to RLNG supply chain and international default by the LNG buyers namely PSO & PLL. However, KE obtained stay against encashment.   He maintained that SSGC has been in continuous communication with KE pursuing payment of outstanding dues but KE is associating its default in payment of RLNG over dues with non-receipt of Tariff Differential Subsidy (TDS) from the Federal Government.   In this regard, SSGC apprised that KE default as of August 01, 2022 has reached Rs26 billion (including LPS of Rs900 million) leading to a situation beyond SSGCs control whereby SSGC will be constrained to gradually reduce gas supplies to KE. DG (Gas) has requested the Power Division to take appropriate measure for release of TDS against the claim raised by KE enabling KE to clear its dues.   According to KE, its TDS claims for April to June 2022 were Rs56.4 billion which have been sent to Power Division, requesting the latter to notify them along with pending determinations as significant amount of TDS is stuck up due to pending notifications of the Schedule of Tariffs (SoTs), consequently impacting the working capital position of the company.   On July 27, 2022, in a letter to Secretary Petroleum, Ali Reza Bhutta, Managing Director SSGCL, Imran Maniar shared previous correspondence with KE and Petroleum Division, in which SSGC noted KE\u2019s continued default in making RLNG bill payment to SSGC and subsequently obtained a Stay Order from Sindh High Court against encashment of Bank guarantees.   Petroleum Division was informed that Moonis Alvi, CEO, KE visited SSGC offices on July 22, 2022 and held a meeting with SSGC management in which KE assured the gas utility company that it would release Rs5 billion plus Rs2 billion against RLNG bill payment during the current week, to maintain overdue amount at Rs18 billion, and will be paying current bills, subsequently.   He also requested for increase in indigenous gas supplies from 10 mmcfd to 20 mmcfd, which is not possible for SSGC with current indigenous gas supply numbers. However, SSGC had not received payment.   In case KE honours its commitment, and SSGC receives Rs. 7 billion from KE, the SSGC receivables would be reduced to the level of Rs18 billion.   For clearance of remaining receivable of Rs18 billion, SSGC management requires Petroleum Division\u2019s intervention to take up the subject matter with Ministry of Finance and ECC for early resolution of KE Tariff Differential Subsidy (TDS).   SSGCL argued that release of KE subsidy would enable KE to clear its dues to SSGCL which would be paid to SNGPL for onward remittance to PSO to save it from international default. MD, SSGC said that Petroleum Division is well aware of the fact that SSGCL is severely trapped in circular debt crisis. Moreover, liquidity issues including non-receipt of payment from industrial consumers like KE has severely affected RLNG supply chain and its effects are so severe that PSO is on the verge of international default and only KE\u2019s timely payment can resolve this grave issue.

Earlier, in November 2006, the Federal Government through Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Resources (now Ministry of Energy - Petroleum Division) executed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO) and China ZhenHua Oil Company Limited (China ZhenHua Oil) with the approval of the then Prime Minister in accordance with the Rules of Business, 1973. In the said MoU, the Federal Government agreed to grant Baska Block to China ZhenHua Oil on G2G basis in accordance with clause 2.1.1(ii) of the Petroleum Policy, 2001. Consequently, the President granted Baska Block No 3070-13 to M/s China ZhenHua Oil. Simultaneously, a Petroleum Concession Agreement (PCA) was also executed with M/s China ZhenHua Oil which transferred 49 per cent working interests out of its 100 per cent working interests to Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) under the terms of Baska PCA. M/s China ZhenHua Oil and PPL could not drill the well due to law and order situation in the area. The current working interest ownership in the Baska Block is as follows: (i) China ZhenHua Oil 51 per cent and (ii) PPL 49 per cent, respectively. M/s ZhenHua Oil now intends to transfer its 33.5 per cent working interests out of its 51 per cent working interests along with operator-ship to PPL and is also willing for the said assignment and change of operator-ship. According to Petroleum Division, there was no cost to the proposed transaction and PPL undertook to perform the remaining firm work commitment. It was also highlighted that Baska Block also had a discovery in the past namely \u201cSavi Ragha\u201d and through drilling of multiple exploratory wells in the future, PPL was reasonably confident to commence commercial production from the Block. Such assignment shall also enable PPL to fulfil social welfare and training obligations as per the Baska PCA and Government guidelines. Article -3 of the MoU reads: \u201cThe ZhenHua Oil Co., Ltd shall not subsequently farm-out this block to any private party and they would take along with a Pakistan public sector E&P company with 49 per cent share.\u201d And Article 5.2 of the Baska Block PCA, provides that \u201cthe licencee shall at all times maintain its 51 per cent working interest and give 49 per cent working interest to Pakistan public sector company(ies).\u201d However, Article 29.6 of the said PCA allowed for amendment, revision or alteration of the PCA on mutual agreement of the working interest owners with the consent of the government. In view of the history, Petroleum Division forwarded a reference to Law Division for obtaining its legal opinion, which replied on October 16, 2019 that the Article 5.2 of the PCA could be amended under the provision of Article 29.6 with the approval of Federal Government, which would be interpreted as the approval of the Federal Government.

This will generate about Rs 666 billion for the gas companies which is Rs 120 billion higher than their ERR for financial year 2022. The surplus revenue would make up for the partial recovery of previous year\u2019s losses. On the regulatory side, the parliamentary adoption of the OGRA Act Amendments in March 2022 will support regular recovery requirements; however, government needs more time than granted in the amended OGRA Act (40 days) to work out the distribution of OGRA\u2019s annual ERR for financial year 2022 (determined in early June 2022) across the slab system.  The IMF has asked Pakistan to speed up efforts to establish reliable gas circular debt (CD) data, a circular debt Management Plan (CDMP) and CD projection capacity. The circular debt in the gas sector has increased from Rs 620 billion to Rs 719 billion in first three quarter (July-March) financial year 2021-22 (about 1 percent of GDP, with Rs 547 billion in system gas arrears and about Rs 172 billion in RLNG arrears).  The report highlighted that the main drivers of gas sector\u2019s circular debt are high unaccounted for gas losses (UFG), delayed sales price adjustments (since September 2020), uncovered subsidies (especially for export and zero-rated industries), and collection shortfalls. If gas companies\u2019 tax adjustments/ refunds, tariff-related recoveries stuck up in courts, and receivables of gas companies, Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL) and Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) from the power sector are included than the circular debt grows to over Rs 1,230 billion at end-March 2022. The report states that one of the main reasons for the accumulated shortfall in revenue is from a failure to cover costs due to the two gas companies (SSGCL and SNGPL) charging the \u2018sale price\u2019 set by the government rather than the \u2018prescribed price\u2019 by OGRA. The increase in the RLNG tariff differential and diversion costs mainly reflects the diversion of costly RLNG to domestic consumers during the last four winter seasons starting in financial year 2019-20 to financial year 2022 is another reason. The government has received early feedback from the World Bank and will continue working with the Bank on the mechanism for regular updates of the end-user gas price, while also rationalizing gas subsidies and implementing the structural pricing changes implied by the recently enacted weighted average cost of gas (WACOG) bill, the report says.

Long term service agreement has been signed with M/s GE for routine maintenance and parts availability and O&M of the plant is done by management of Guddu. On July 10, fire incident occurred at steam turbine number 16 (ST-16) and generator. Initial assessment was that the fire occurred due to short circuit owing to rain in the area. A formal inquiry committee under CEO Muzaffargarh was constituted to assess the real reasons for the incident. One-man committee of PD Baloki was also tasked to provide an independent report. Both the committees have given the opinion that fire incident occurred due to hydrogen leakage which could not be detected by the relevant O&M teams. According to sources, both the committees also observed that this was not a recent issue as the leakage was going on for quite some time which shows negligence on the part of O&M teams. As per the recommendations of the main committee the relevant officials have been suspended and formal proceedings have been initiated against them, the sources said adding that restoration of overhead cranes has been initiated which is essential to lift the machine casings.  M/s Nespak has been engaged for consultancy services for restoration of generator and steam turbine whereas M/s SGS is also being engaged to facilitate the restoration work.

According to the Petroleum Division, old units of TPSG have very low efficiency and have outlived their useful generation lives. These units continue to remain in operation despite having low generation efficiency and having directions of the CCoE ratified by the Cabinet for phased decommissioning and de-licensing of inefficient units besides submitting a phasing out plan by Power Division.  The units of 747 MW CCPP are the only efficient units with thermal efficiency of 55% and are currently on the active list of privatisation and Power Division has already requested separate allocation of up to 156 mmcfd gas along with execution or Gas Sale Agreement (GSA) with Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) for the 747 MW CCPP. On March 28, 2017, the ECC besides revalidating the expired allocation of 150 mmcfd, approved additional allocation of 50 mmcfd from Kandhkot gas field. Additional supply started in June, 2017.For supply of gas from Kandhkot field to TPSG, there are three dedicated Kandhkot (KK) pipelines, ie, KK-I, KK-II & KK-III each with a capacity of up to 90 mmcfd. Mari is connected with TPSG through a dedicated line.  Petroleum Division maintains that the analysis of gas offtakes provides a picture of sub-optimal and inefficient utilization of a very scarce natural resource by TPSG for past many years. Mari is now connected with SNGPL network at two separate injection points. Kandhkot on the other hand does not have connectivity either with SSGCL or SNGPL for possible utilization of undrawn/underutilized Kandhkot gas. As of June 30, 2022, the receivables of PPL, MPCL and SNGPL on account of gas supply to Guddu Power Plant have piled up to Rs. 256.99 billion. Both PPL and MPCL have been making requests for redressal of sub-optimal use of gas and payment issues.  The Nepra in its Annual Report(s) titled State of Regulated Industry has been consistently reporting the underperformance of TPSG in terms of its power generation as well as plant utilization.  As of December, 2021, the remaining recoverable gas reserves of Kandhkot gas field are 469 Billion Cubic Feet (BCF) which can last for 6-8 years provided that the gas production rate is maintained at 150-200 mmcfd. Considering the specification of Kandhkot gas, it cannot be utilized into the system unless it is processed and conditioned before injection either into SSGCL or SNGPL network. Estimated expenditure on the installation of gas processing facility is US$ 95 million with 18 -24 months\u2019 time for completion of such a facility. Assuming flow of up to 100 mmcfd gas from Kandhkot, the possible options of connectivity with existing SSGCL and SNGPL network are as follows: (i) SSGCL-Kandhkot-Shahi Wah Kashmore (18inch x 25 kms, Rs 3.1 billion; and (ii) Kandhkot-Shikarpur (18inch x 65 kms, Rs 7.6 billion. SNGPL - (i) Kandhkot Qadirpur field (18 inch x50 kms) Rs 8.71 billion; and (iii) Kandhkot-Guddu-Qadirpur (20-inch x 114 kms) Rs 12.84 billion.   After explaining the case, the Petroleum Division has submitted following proposals for effective and efficient utilization of Kandhkot gas field during its remaining useful production life: (i) considering low efficiency of older units of Guddu power, only 747 MW CCCP may be provided gas up to 156 mmcfd gas for which separate GSA would be executed on take-or-pay basis. The gas over and above 156 mmcfd threshold may be allocated to SSGCL to whoever has the nearest injection network to meet its demand/supply deficit; (ii) SSGCL would be required to undertake construction of pipeline connecting Kandhkot filed with its network; (iii) both PPL and SSGCL would expeditiously complete the installation or processing plant and pipeline for early injection of gas. Upon availability of gas in SSGCL  system, Government may decide to further  allocate this gas to any bulk customer preferably fertilizer and/or industry on SSGCL network; (iv) in order to enable PPL to invest in installation of gas processing facility (- $ 95 million ), gas compression (- $ 25 million) and to drill the additional wells at the cost of $ 40 million for extension in the plateau period of production, the wellhead gas price of Kandhkot gas may be fixed at Petroleum Policy 2012 for volumes over 150 mmcfd. Any undrawn/unutilized volume or TPSG diverted to SSGCL may also be charged at Petroleum Policy 2012.

The issues of Pak-Iran Gas Pipeline, joint projects between OGDCL, National Oil Refinery (NIOC) and pending issues between NTDC, CPPA-G and Iranian company Tavanir will also come under discussion, in addition to promotion of barter trade and payment mechanism. Sharing details on Pak-Iran Gas Pipeline, the sources said that both sides have emphasized their commitment towards early solution of IP project under GSPA and agreed to take necessary measures. In this regard, Petroleum Division has communicated that the government of Pakistan is committed to implement the project. During the visit of Prime Minister of Pakistan to Iran in April 2019, it was agreed that the legal teams from both sides would engage in finding out plausible legal solutions for the implementation of the project. Accordingly, both sides executed an Amendment Agreement No. 3 to the Iran Pakistan Gas Sales and Purchase Agreement (IP-GSPA) with NIOC on 5th September, 2019 in Istanbul, Turkey. Consequent to the signing of the Amendment Agreement No. 3, both sides have extended period of limitation for any claims under or in connection with the IP-GSPA as it is permitted under the applicable French law, allowing more time to the Parties to engage and further discuss the way forward on the IP project. On joint projects between OGDCL and National Iranian Oil Company NIOC, the sources said, during 20th session of JEC, Pakistani side expressed OGDCL & PPL interest in evaluating the E&P opportunities in Iran. According to sources, OGDCL has expressed the desire to work as joint venture partner with NIOC for exploration of hydrocarbons within Iran and worldwide. ODGCL would also like to join hands with National Iranian Oil Company in evaluation of the potential of unexpected areas, shale gas, tight gas reserves, and enhanced oil recovery projects in Pakistan. However, due to US sanctions, no cooperation could have been materialized so far. WAPDA and TAVANIR entered into a contract agreement for 30 years for 32-MW electricity on November 6, 2002 to meet the requirement of Makran Division in Balochistan. The rates per kwh were revised from time to time. The last revision was made on March 15, 2019. TAVANIR has also shown an interest to supply power to other bordering areas. Quetta Electric Supply Company is working on this and a response will be conveyed to Iranian side shortly. The sources maintained that MoU was signed in April 08, 2007 for import of 1000-KW power from Zahedan, Iran to Quetta, Pakistan. Feasibility report concluded jointly was submitted to NTDC in 2010. The estimated cost will be $700 million. NTDC approved the MoU in 2012; however, the approval of ECC is awaited. After approval of ECC the PPA will be negotiated with Tavanir. As decided in 2014 during the 19h session of Pak-Iran JEC, necessary arrangements have been made to make outstanding payments to Tavanir\u2019s designated companies within Pakistan. This was further reinforced during the meeting held in 2019 between Tavanir, Power Division, Central Power Purchasing Agency, Pakistan (CPPA-G) and National Transmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC). As modus operandi, CCPA-G discharges itself of payment obligations by receiving Payment Order Letters (POL) from TAVANIR nominated beneficiary for receipt of payments in Pakistani rupees and makes payments as per its liquidity situation. Such payments are later on confirmed by Tavanir. According to sources, CPPA-G has noted that as on September 17, 2020, payment of about $100 million to Tavanir  on account of import of electricity is pending due to non- availability of banking channels. However, payment against authority letter i.e. POL-31 is in process. NTDC had earlier requested M/o Commerce to develop some formal mechanism for making outstanding payment owed by CPPA-G to Tavanir.

The Petroleum Division Secretary replied that it was one of the requirements in all commercial agreements which could not be renegotiated; otherwise Saudi Arabia had to renegotiate all commercial contracts with other countries. He maintained that the federal government was importing oil from Qatar on credit facility of 80 days and LCs were opened on spot purchase. Pakistan was importing crude and refined fuel from various countries on long-term contracts, he added. He further revealed that the Petroleum Division was formulating a policy to give an extension of licences to the oil and gas exploration companies on the condition that they would resume their operations. Many of the foreign companies wind up their operation in Pakistan, he added. The committee further directed the Secretary Petroleum to probe into claims of the previous Government of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) that Russia was ready to supply oil at cheaper rates. Member Committee from the PTI Syed Shibli Faraz recommended the secretary to find out any initial discussion between Pakistan and Russian available in written on oil import. Responding to another question regarding local oil and gas production, the secretary said that Oil and Gas Development Company (OGDCL) and Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) and other exploration and production companies had suspended their operations in various places as they did not have investment as the circular debt of oil and gas reached to Rs1.5 trillion and reliance on imported fuel was increasing. The Chairman Committee observed that one of the reasons that contributed to a decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) in the oil and gas sector was the lengthy process of the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) awarding licenses to a company. He said OGRA was creating hurdles in the inflow of foreign investment in the oil and gas sector and was not resolving their issues. The secretary said, \u201cYes, it is a perception about the OGRA but everyone has his own opinion\u201d.

Sharing the background, he said, EPQL entered gas insufficiency phase in September 2018 when Qadirpur gas field production levels were depleted to an extent that base load was permeate and gas supplies were not available for EPQL which has since then, followed the procedure envisaged under the Implementation Agreement (IA) to work with the stakeholder (including PPIB, CPPA-G SNGPL, NTDC, NEPRA, etc.) to identify and select an alternate fuel for EPQL power plant which can be used in conjunction with permeate gas. EPQL submitted the initial Gas Depletion Mitigation Plan (GDMP) in April 2019, updated GDMP in October 2019 and again in November, 2019. In this regard the stakeholders identified RLNG as the most viable option for mitigation of gas depletion. Final GDMP was submitted in September 2020 and after extensive and exhaustive consultation, stakeholders have finalized RLNG as the Gas Depletion Mitigation Option (GDMO) in March 2021. During the Pendency of GDMO notification and implementation, EPQL has been operating on mix fuel and making plant available on permeate gas and HSD. EPQL has even received dispatch on HSD, which is the most expensive fuel for Power generation and approximately 25 million units have been produced by EBQL on HSD between July 2021 and January 2022.  \u201cHad these units generated on RLNG instead of HSD, electricity basket price would have been lower by approximately Rs 400 million (computed at current rates),\u201d said CEO EPQL. Accordingly, further delay in the notification by the GoP of RLNG as the GDMO for EPQL will continue to result in substantial losses for both the power consumers and the national exchequer. Had the GDMO been notified in a timely manner and EPQL Plant was available on RLNG, it could have provided over 500 million units of electricity at much lower rates compared to HSD/RFO from July 2021, resulting in potential reduction of electricity basket price by at least Rs 2 billion and forex savings of approximately $ 11.4 million in the last seven months. This invariably shows that RLNG is a cheaper fuel option in the generation mix compared to RFO/HSD. He further contended that EPQL fuel cost component on HSD is Rs 33.3/ unit as per the merit order published on February 16, 2022 whereas the plant\u2019s fuel cost component on current RLNG rate worked out to Rs 17.3 per unit. He maintained that as per the most recent projected gas profile shared by SNGPL by end of 2022, permeate gas volumes (at the Qadirpur field) are expected to go down even further to a level where even minimum load operation of EPQL (90 MW) will require fuel to be commingled. Unless GDMO is immediately notified and RLNG is made available for commingling, HSD will continue to be used and commingled with permeate gas, leading to higher electricity tariff. Another possible implication will be the non-utilization of available permeate gas as commingling with HSD will result in a higher tariff and lower dispatch leading to an even bigger economic loss and perhaps expensive power generation on RFO/ HSD instead of permeate gas.   According to M/s Engro, it was recently learnt that Petroleum Division is planning to reallocate some volume (100 MMCFD) of Kandhkot gas to other consumers to enhance the off-take from the field. It is the company\u2019s understanding that the Kandhkot gas field, which is located 30 km from EPQL power plant, is presently allocated to Guddu Power Plant, but the gas off-take from that source has remained extremely low in a past few years due to chronic operational and maintenance issues at the Guddu Power Plant. The company believes EPQL is a natural/ ideal consumer for Kandhkot gas as EPQL is located just 30km from Kandhkot and EPQL\u2019s plant has been specifically designed for the consumption of low BTU gas with high H2S content. The power company is of the view that supplementing the permeate gas supply with 25- 55 MMCFD (off-take from Kandhkot will increase as Qadirpur field depletes) gas volume from Kandhkot will enable EPQL to produce cheap electricity, particularly when compared to imported fuels such as HSD, and further enhance the energy security of the country. The company has claimed that its plant has operated with a very high capacity/ availability factor over the last 12 years of operations which is testament to its excellent O&M practices. The power company says it foresees the following potential benefits for utilizing indigenous permeate and Kandhkot gas at EPQL: (i) It can lower the overall energy basket price for the power sector resulting in potential benefit of over Rs. 300 billion to the consumers over next 13 years: (ii) it can potentially produce 23 billion units of electricity over remaining PPA term of EPQL plant (till 2035), which in turn can provide forex savings of up to $ 2 billion versus imported coal/ fuel); and (iii) assuming the stability of current gas prices, the supply of Kandhkot gas to EPQL can result in potential revenue of Rs 150 billion for PPL/ GoP till 2035.

A new agreement was signed by representatives of the federal and Balochistan governments with a delegation of Barrick Gold, led by Chief Executive Dr. Mark Bristow. As per the terms of the new agreement, the Reko Diq project would be revived and developed by Barrick Gold in partnership with Pakistani entities. The new project will be owned 50 percent by Barrick Gold and the remaining 50 percent shareholding will be owned by Pakistan, divided equally between federal government and the provincial government of Balochistan. Federal government\u2019s 25 percent shareholding will be divided equally amongst three state-owned-entities (SOEs) \u2013 Oil & Gas Development Corporation Limited (OGDCL), Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) and Government Holdings Pakistan Limited (GHPL). Balochistan\u2019s share will be held by a company wholly owned and controlled by the government of Balochistan. As part of the Prime Minister\u2019s vision for Balochistan, the government of Balochistan\u2019s share of capital and operating expenses for the project will be borne by the federal government which means provincial government would not incur any expenses in development of the mines. For developing the project, nearly US$ 10 billion would be invested in Balochistan, including US$ 1 billion that will be invested in social uplift projects such as roads, schools, hospitals and creation of technical training institute for mining. The investment will create over 8000 new jobs. This project will make Balochistan the largest recipient of foreign direct investment in Pakistan and the Reko Diq project will be one of the largest copper and gold mining projects in the world. To ensure optimal utilization of nation\u2019s mineral wealth the government is also considering setting up a smelter. The agreement was reached after several rounds of negotiations over the last three years. In August 2019, the Prime Minister had set up a committee to steer the negotiations with an aim for early development of the mines. In this effort, the federal and provincial governments were assisted by international advisors. To ensure the deal is compliant with all the laws, the government would submit the matter before the parliament and the Supreme Court. While speaking at the occasion, the Prime Minister stressed on the emphasis his government places on development of Balochistan and uplift of underdeveloped areas. He expressed hope that the investment will change the quality of lives of ordinary citizens in Balochistan. He appreciated the efforts of the negotiating team for a transparent and favourable agreement for the people of Balochistan. Earlier, the delegation of Barrick Gold Corporation called on the Prime Minister. Canadian High Commissioner to Pakistan Wendy Gilmour was also present. Later, addressing a news conference Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin along with the Minister for Energy Hammad Azhar and Chief Minister Balochistan Abdul Quddus Bizenjo stated that that an award of $5.9 billion was given against Pakistan with per day fine of $700 million. Along with that London Court of Arbitration also opened a case against government of Balochistan and $4 billion dollar is ready against Pakistan. Tarin said that if the government had not reached an agreement, Pakistan would have to pay $11 billion. He further stated that after since 2019, the prime minister pursued solution of the problem and an Apex body was formed which made a deal with previous company at $900 million which nullified their claim of $3.25 billion. Finance Minister said that Barrick Gold said it would continue in the project with 50percent share, adding that 25 percent has been given to the Balochistan without taking any money from the province and remaining 25 percent shareholders are SOEs \u2013 PPL, OGDCL and GHPL. The minister said that this deal has nullified $11 billion damages and Barrick and other partners would invest $10 billion in the project. Province of Balochistan would benefit from the project over 100 years besides 8000 jobs would also be created. The income flow of the project is more than $100 billion and the governments of the Balochistan and federal government would get taxes and royalty. This is a big news for today and this would not have happened if the Prime Minister Imran Khan would not be in the power, he said. However, federal minister Hammad Azhar said that extraction of Reko Diq, biggest gold and copper reserves of the world, would now be started and all the litigation doors have been closed and damages and process of attaching Pakistan foreign properties would end now. He said that PPL, OGDCL and GHPL would pay $900 million and would be shareholders of 25 percent. He said that last time Balochistan government share was 15 percent, adding and Pakistan single largest investment of $10 billion would be made in the province of Baluchistan. He said that this is not the only thing the present government led by Prime Minister Imran Khan has done but before this Karkey Company award was done away with, FATF blacklisting was avoided whose 32 points out of 34 are complete now and IPPs agreements were renegotiated.

The federal government\u2019s 25% shareholding will be divided equally amongst three state-owned entities (SOEs) \u2013 Oil & Gas Development Corporation Limited (OGDCL), Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) and Government Holdings Pakistan Limited (GHPL).  On the agreement, Tarin while talking to a private news channel, said that the life of the contract is 40 years. \u201cDuring its lifespan, the project will generate over $100 billion in revenue, which will boost economic activity in Balochistan,\u201d he said, adding that Reko Diq holds the world's largest copper reserves, which remained unutilised. He said that $900 million in settlement would be paid by the investors, \u201cwhich is beneficial for them as well, as this is a huge project,\u201d Tarin said. The Reko Diq mine is located in the district Chaghi of Balochistan and is potentially one of the world\u2019s largest undeveloped mine with an estimated copper and gold deposit of around 27,173mn Ibs and 16,098k oz. On economic fundamentals, the finance minister said that the tightening measures adopted by the government are bearing fruits. \u201cWe were tightening the import bill since November, and the result of the measures was reflected in February, as our imports declined from $6.5 billion to $5.1 billion, registering a drop of $1.4 billion.  \"Meanwhile, the exports have risen to $2.9 billion from $2.5 billion, and remittances recorded a growth. Combining all of these figures led to a decrease in current account deficit from $2.5 billion in January to just over $500 million in February,\u201d he said.  month-on-month, clocking in at $545 million in February 2022, the lowest in the ongoing fiscal year, showed data released by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).  Tarin said that the trend would continue in the coming months as well. \u201cWe are moving back towards under a billion-dollar deficit, which is a result of economic growth. \u201cOur LSM sector grew by 8.2% in February, which translates into 7.6% growth in LSM in the seven months of the fiscal year,\u201d he said, adding that the economy is moving towards sustainable growth. On current inflation figures, Tarin said that the  , which was mostly due to tomato rates, as it registered an exponential rise in prices. \u201cIf we exclude this, the CPI rate has come down to 10.8%. The good news is that the weekly SPI has dropped by 1.17%, and is expected that the headline inflation would also reduce,\u201d said Tarin.

On May 17, 2022, in his letter to Finance Minister, CEO KE, stated that the base tariff, which was at Rs 22.5 per unit in June 2021, has also been significantly increased to Rs 31 per unit in March 2022 whereas consumer tariff stood at around Rs 19 per unit.  According to him, the increase in base tariff is due to the recent significant increase in fuel prices including RLNG, as well as, the non-provision of local gas to KE. CEO of KE argued that as a result of the strained cash flow position due to the continuous accumulation of receivables from government entities, KE\u2019s total borrowings have reached an unsustainable level of Rs 236 billion, which includes Rs 144 billion mainly on account of working capital requirements.  KE\u2019s borrowing levels on June 30, 2021 were Rs184 billion including Rs 116 billion representing mainly the working capital requirements. He maintained that whilst the banks have financed the historical increase in fuel prices, the exposure to KE has already reached an alarming level, adding that unfortunately the lending capacity of majority of the banks has already been exhausted due to which KE is no longer in a position to finance the existing and incremental price hike. CEO has sought help of Finance Minister for intervention and support to release TDS directly to KE to enable KE to keep the operations afloat. In this regard, within the Fiscal Budget for FY 2022, Rs 57 billion was approved for KE\u2019s TDS, out of which CPPA-G received Rs 10.5 billion during the year. Accordingly, KE has requested release of budgeted allocation of Rs 46.5 billion, at least Rs 25 billion be released immediately to KE, enabling KE to manage the company\u2019s severely constrained cash flow position. \u201cWe request Ministry to release net TDS (TDS claim less CPPA Bill) to enable KE to continue making timely payments to SSGC, PLL, and PSO for RLNG/ indigenous gas and furnace oil,\u201d he said, adding that due to the precarious situation, any delay may significantly impact the sustainability of KE\u2019s operations, resulting in a potential power supply crisis for Karachi, the ramifications of which would be far-reaching for the city\u2019s residents and businesses.

It is appreciable that the government is also considering setting up a smelter to ensure optimal utilization of the nation\u2019s mineral wealth. It is a right step in the right direction that the Balochistan government would not incur any expenses in development of the mines after this agreement. Its share of expenses shall be borne by the federal government. In developing the project, nearly $10 billion will be invested in Balochistan, including $1 billion for social uplift projects \u2014 roads, schools, hospitals and creation of technical training institute for mining. The investment will create over 8,000 new jobs. He said Reko Diq would potentially be the largest gold and copper mine in the world and it will liberate Pakistan from crippling debt and usher in a new era of development and prosperity. The businessmen congratulate the nation and people of Balochistan on successful agreement with Barrick Gold for development of Reko Diq mine after 10 years of legal battles and negotiations, he said. Penalty of approximately $11 billion is offset while $10 billion will be invested in Balochistan creating 8,000 new jobs, he added. Anjum Nisar said some $10 billion would be invested in the province under this project, creating 8,000 new jobs for the locals. The government was actively engaged with Tethyan Copper Company \u2014 a consortium between the Canadian based mining company Barrick Gold and Chile\u2019s Antofagasta to work specifically on the Reko Diq project \u2014 to reach a settlement as the country was threatened with facing a penalty of $6.5 billion because of its top court\u2019s decision to deny a mining lease to the firm. According to settlement, 50% of the new project\u2019s shares will be owned by Barrick Gold, while the remaining shares shall be owned by Pakistan, divided equally between the Centre and the Balochistan government. The federal government\u2019s shares of 25% will be divided equally among three state-owned entities \u2014 namely the Oil and Gas Development Corporation Limited (OGDCL), Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL), and Government Holdings Pakistan Limited (GHPL). As per the terms of the new agreement, the Reko Diq project will be revived and developed by Barrick Gold in partnership with Pakistani entities.  The agreement has been reached after several rounds of negotiations over the last three years. In August 2019, the prime minister had set up a committee to steer the negotiations with an aim for early development of the mines. In this effort, the federal and provincial governments were assisted by international advisors including a law firm, White & Case, and an investment bank, Lazard. To ensure the deal is compliant with all the laws, the government will submit the matter before parliament and the Supreme Court. It has been learnt that future governments would continue this project wherein $100 billion would be earned. On July 29, 1993, the BHP Minerals (BHP) and the Balochistan Development Authority (BDA) had signed the Chagai Hills Exploration Joint Venture Agreement (CHEJVA). Subsequently, on Nov 23, 2006, the TCC had bought the BHP\u2019s interests in CHEJVA for $240 million. On August 26, 2011, the TCC had submitted its feasibility report and an application for mining lease which was rejected by the licensing authority on November 15, 2011. On November 6, 2011, a petition was filed before the Supreme Court asking the top court to order the Balochistan government to refrain from issuing a mining license in an arbitrary and unlawful manner.

In accordance with the decisions of the meeting, the CPPA-G has also approached this Division that due to rising fuel prices and payments required to be made to the IPA, the sector is still facing a shortfall of about Rs200 billion. The CPPA-G has requested that a supplementary grant of Rs50 billion is required immediately to ensure the availability of requisite fuel to cope with the increasing demand of electricity during the summer months. It is reiterated that the power sector is currently facing a liquidity crisis which has worsened due to the rise in energy prices in the international market. In this scenario, the credit lines of IPPs have exhausted to procure fuel and IPPs are pressing hard for clearance of the outstanding receivables. Therefore, immediate cash release is required to manage the liquidity crunch. The Ministry of Industries and Production submitted a summary for extension of the Prime Minister\u2019s Relief Package-2020 and fixation of ghee prices at the Utility Stores Corporation. The ECC approved an extension in the Prime Minister\u2019s Relief Package-2020 up to 30th June 2022 on all five essential items and allowed that ghee shall be sold on all the USC outlets throughout the country @ Rs300/kg from 9th June 2022 irrespective of the higher market prices. The ECC further approved an allocation of funds Rs3,447.60 million in favour of the USC through a supplementary grant.

The meeting was informed that the Pakistan International Airline Corporation Limited (PIACL) is going to induct four A320 aircrafts on dry lease basis for the period of 72 months. Due to financial constraints, the PIACL is not in a position to pay GST on the total rental value in lump sum.

The price differential claim (PDC) is going to be higher and OMCs fear that government may not clear these in times. That would create serious cashflow problems for OMCs and they may refrain from importing which could in turn potentially cause shortages. At the same time, banks are reluctant to enhance credit limits for OMCs. After the Hascol fiasco, banks do not perceive the sector to be low risk anymore. The government must define the mechanism (as soon as possible) for smooth supply of petroleum products. Otherwise, private players may refrain (or reduce imports) which would put the burden on the PSO to fill in the supply gap. Since PSO is a government-owned entity, this would keep on taking the hit on the balance sheet for ensuring adequate supply. That is not good. Already, other state-owned companies in the energy chain have hampered cashflows due to high power and gas circular debts \u2013 such as OGDC, PPL, SNGP and SSGC. Not a good idea to add petroleum in it. At the latest imported prices, the net subsidy on petroleum products is not much considering the custom duties (CD) being charged on these products at the import stage. The CD has increased to 10 percent in the latest budget. And ex-refinery prices are inclusive of it. However, the local refineries charge 7.5 percent duty on HSD and 2.5 percent on petrol (as deemed duty) while they pay CD of 2.5 percent on crude import. The difference is adjusted in the IFEM (inland freight equalization margin). The IFEM is usually higher than what is presented in the final price sheet. Then there used to be GST on crude which used to be adjusted on the final stage of petroleum product. However, since the GST on petroleum product has been less lately and now being zero, there was another refund (cashflow) problem developing for refineries, and that GST on crude is now abolished in the recent supplementary budget. When the government took the decision of lowering the petroleum prices, the government was net positive on revenues on petroleum imports. For example, the imported price (including premiums) was $119.3/barrel for HSD and $117.8/barrel for petrol. And that price, the PDC is computed at Rs13/liter for HSD and Rs8.4/liter for petrol. The GST is zero. And CD is computed at Rs13.6/liter and Rs13.4/liter for HSD and petrol, respectively. On these numbers, at monthly assumed sale of 600,000 tons of HSD and 700,000 tons of petrol, the government is still getting net revenues of Rs5 billion a month \u2013 CD collected minus PDC to be paid. However, the government is forgoing petroleum levy of Rs51 billion at full Rs30/liter and Rs42 billion on GST at full 17 percent. The overall forgone revenues a month are Rs93 billion on PL and GST. Add Rs18 billion of PDC in it, the total revenue potential loss of the government is Rs111 billion a month. Still government (at the above-mentioned price) is getting net revenues of Rs5 billion. However, the equation is changing fast. The prices are moving up. And likely to stay high for the time being. The price on the last working day (inclusive of premium) was $137/barrel and $125/barrel for HSD and petrol. At this price, the forgone revenue on PL and GST is computed at Rs97 billion. The PDC is computed at Rs42 billion. The total revenue loss to the exchequer is Rs140 billion and adjusting to CD, the loss is Rs115 billion. At this rate, the revenue loss for the government for four months (till budget) will be at Rs560 billion \u2013 around Rs390 billion on PL and GST while around Rs170 billion on PDC. The government will collect around Rs100 billion on CD and the net subsidy would be around Rs70 billion. Seeing all these numbers, OMCs are not willing to import without having a mechanism of government paying them the PDC amount. A good chunk can be adjusted against CD being charged and rest must be paid (if prices remain high) through direct fiscal injection. Situation is tough, as there is already a tussle going on between OMCs and banks on enhancing their financing limits. The prices have moved up and OMCs limits are exhausting. SBP is pushing banks to enhance limits. Banks are wary about the sector as they got their hands badly burnt in Hascol fiasco. And on top, the cashflow adjustments of PDC would require even higher financing. Then OMCs (even if they get financing) are reluctant to assume risk of receivables as some have pending receivables from 2008. This is all messed up. The government must come up with a swift mechanism for paying subsidies. Otherwise, there would be shortage in harvesting season which is coinciding with holy month of Ramzan.

We can produce only power from these resources so there will be no change in the cost and fluctuation in money,\u201d said Shahab, adding that local resources give greater control on fuel cost \u2014 the biggest issue. \u201cLuckily we have all these three options. We are blessed. Thar coal was a dream sometime back and now it is being utilized for the last four years,\u201d said Shahab. He said Sindh is energy capital where Thar has coal, Jhimpir has wind, and Ghotki and surrounding areas have good low BTU gas reserves. He said power policies should liberalize markets and local fuels should be incentivized. Currently Pakistan has 60% imported fuel and 40% local in its energy mix while it should be around 80% to 85% local and just 15% imported.  \u201cOur policies should keep the risk of selling power with the developers so that they go for local fuels,\u201d said Shahab, adding that currently we are paying to foreign fuel resources instead of funding our own resources. He added that power policies from 1994 allowed private investment thus IPPs for 20 to 22 thousand MWs with 60 to 70 billion dollar investment did come to Pakistan but unfortunately most of them were projects based on imported fuel. \u201cSo it was an interesting situation of a commodity that has local consumption with imported raw material,\u201d said Shahab, adding that one study shows that Pakistan imported fuel worth $85 billion dollars since 1994. Shahab said that Pakistan has foreign debt of around $84 billion yet, unfortunately, Pakistan spent borrowings from the IMF on luxury items and power projects run on imported fuels. \u201cThe policy should have support for indigenization of fuel options. India and China adopted this indigenous fuel option to eradicate poverty while Bangladesh is also following this trend,\u201d said Shahab. He added that Bangladesh\u2019s government is subsidizing their industry, not the domestic consumers, but here in Pakistan subsidy is given on domestic consumption. \u201cThe Bangladesh\u2019s industry then pays back to the government through employment, taxes, and exports,\u201d said Shahab, adding Bangladesh\u2019s industry generates dollars through exports and pays for their imported fuel. But, he added, in Pakistan the problem is that imported fuel is used for power generation and the consumption is domestic despite that local and renewable fuel options have lots of potential to help Pakistan achieve its economic goals. \u201cSo, instead of spending 8 to 9 billion dollars, which is now 15 billion, on importing fuel, we should use local fuel options to get rid of the IMF,\u201d reasoned Shahab. He said that receivables are the biggest issue for the local power sector and payments from the government are slow; therefore, the situation on liquidity is vulnerable. \u201cIn order to stop the rise in fuel cost the government has to indigenize fuel options. They can do balloon payments to the sector and use cheaper fuel and this is a long-term solution,\u201d said Shahab.  He briefed about the Qadirpur project of Engro which was conceived in 2006 under power policy 2002 and it was commissioned in 2010. \u201cThe project performed far better than expectations. The projection was to produce 8 to 10 billion units but in the last two years we produced 60% more results with 16 billion units and now 6 billion more can be produced,\u201d said Shahab. He said that the EPQL project generated 80 billion rupees from nothing for OGDCL and if this project were not commissioned the government would have spent $1.3 billion on an RFO plant. When asked about challenges to this project, Shahab said that the challenges are depletion of reserves as every local gas project faces this challenge. \u201cNow the options are to look for more reserves in the area after 2018. Currently, we are producing 110MWs from 32mmcf gas while the remaining 100MWs is being produced from HSD,\u201d said Shahab. He said that they proposed a solution to the government to connect the plant with RLNG as the annual impact is of Rs 13 billion if production is done through RNLG instead of HSD. \u201cWe also requested the government to give us gas from Kandhkot so that we can continue producing power at Rs 7-8 per unit,\u201d said Shahab. He added that they can produce 800 million units this way to save Rs 20 billion per month and this saving can be utilized to fund a pipeline to the EPQL (pipeline cost is Rs 2 billion and can be laid down in three months). \u201cWe have asked the government to give us this gas on \u2018as and when\u2019 basis. Only 3-4 months are required for this solution and the economy can start having benefits,\u201d said Shahab. He said they have talked to the Ministry of Petroleum and are expecting an early decision in this regard because this solution will lessen the burden on Forex reserves and reduce circular debt. \u201cAny energy that is cheaper eases circular debt. Also, this is PKR transaction as dollars are being replaced with local currency,\u201d said Shahab. To a question about the unavailability of both RNLG and gas from Kandhkot, he said that gas from Kandhkot should be available because HSD is always expensive. \u201cThe 95% plant will be run on gas from Kandhkot. And we don\u2019t even seek any commitment from the government in this regard like gas can be given to the plant on an availability basis,\u201d said Shahab. He said that EPQL can potentially produce 23 billion units of electricity over its remaining Power Purchasing Agreement (PPA) term till 2035, which will result in a potential benefit of over Rs. 300 billion to the consumers over the next 13 years. \u201cThe 23 billion units can provide foreign exchange savings of up to $2 billion versus imported coal/ fuel,\u201d said Shahab, adding that it can also result in potential revenue of Rs 150 billion for Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) or the government till 2035. \u201cThe plant would need Rs 450 to 550 billion for running on the imported fuel for the next 13 years. This is the reason this allocation of gas to EPQL is very positive for Pakistan to help overcome its energy challenges,\u201d reasoned Shahab.  He said that over the last 12 years of its operations, the EPQL plant has operated with a very high capacity/ availability factor and is an ideal candidate for this gas allocation. \u201cThe EPQL plant is specifically designed for consumption of low BTU gas with high Sulphur; therefore, it can prudently utilize the Kandhkot gas field to produce cheaper electricity,\u201d said Shahab.

Finance Ministry argues that the unprecedented hike in LNG import cost necessitates a revisit of the currently followed electricity Tariff Differential Subsidy (TDS) policy, i.e., absorption/ payment of entire TDS by the Federal government worked out on the basis of lowest tariff determination by NEPRA of an efficient Disco and notified as a uniform tariff to provide maximum relief to end consumers across the country. The policy has led to an unsustainable yawning gap in the fiscal space and finally translated into the circular debt, currently hovering around Rs. 2.4 trillion. Finance Ministry maintains that the immediate way forward to address the flow of circular debt, as well as, to address the liquidity crisis like situation is to notify the average tariff of all Discos as uniform tariff with the approval of the competent authority, i.e., ECC/ Cabinet. For sustained supply of subsidized gas to industrial including zero-rated sector, Finance Ministry has proposed that subsidized LNG rate may be determined keeping in view the fiscal space provided through budgetary allocation for the next fiscal year to help prevent the flow of circular debt in the gas sector. Finance Division says that it will place the requisite amount in the demand of Petroleum Division which will ensure that the entire amount is transferred to PSO and PLL, as deemed appropriate, without any deduction by the SNGPL. It will also place the requisite amount in the demand of Petroleum Division and Petroleum Division will open a separate head for subsidy on LNG supply to domestic sector and the SG/ TSG will be adjusted against the SNGPL\u2019s subsidy claims. Finance Division has requested Petroleum Division to provide approval of the ECC/ Cabinet regarding diversion of LNG to domestic sector, during the ECC meeting and processing the release by Finance Division. Petroleum Division will release the amount to SNGPL against the principal amount of verified subsidy claims. Petroleum Division, in its summary, has claimed that Pakistan State Oil Company Limited (PSO) and Pakistan LNG Limited (PLL) are importing LNG to minimize shortfall in the gas demand and supply. The re-gasified LNG is supplied by SSGC and SNGPL to consumers including power sector as major consumer in summer months.  During June to Sep 2022, maximum LNG is planned to be imported for supply to power sector to minimize load shedding.  According to the plan, PSO will import 6 cargoes each month starting from June to September 2022. PLL will also import same quantity of cargoes during these months, of this in June, July and September 2022 three cargoes each to be imported on term basis whereas the same quantity will be imported on spot. However, in August 2022, one cargo will be on term basis and five cargoes on spot. The planned import will be subject to securing spot cargoes through tenders and timely opening of LCs and payments to LNG suppliers. SNGPL has planned to supply 720 to 780 MMCFD to power sector whereas PLL will be ramping up its direct supplies to KE from 62 MMCFD in July to 130 MMCFD in Oct 2022. Due to Russia-Ukraine situation and international demand supply dynamics, the price of one spot LNG cargo is hovering around Rs. 15 to 16 billion, enhancing the liquidity requirement of LNG importers. Besides LNC import PSO is also importing Furnace Oil (FO) to meet demand of power sector, which is adding to its financial constraints. PSO and PLL have furnished their projected liquidity requirement during summer months. The overall gross liquidity requirement of both PSO and PLL will be Rs 1.977 trillion till September 2022 of which Rs 525 billion will be for June, Rs 489 billion for July, Rs 493 billion for August and Rs 470 billion for September. PSO\u2019s financial requirement will be Rs 1.699 trillion for both LNG and furnace oil, of which Rs 427 billion is required for June, Rs 445 billion for July, Rs 413 billion for August, Rs 414 billion for September. PLL\u2019s gross liquidity requirements will be Rs 278 billion of which Rs 98 billion will be for June, Rs 44 billion for July, Rs 80 billion August, Rs 56 billion for September.  The requirements have been discussed with relevant stakeholders while considering the projected receipts of PSO and PLL from SNGPL, SSCC, power sector and credit lines available with the companies.  It was concluded that there will be still an average shortfall of Rs. 52 billion per month (PSO Rs 39 billion PLL Rs 14 billion) as per following details: (i) June - Rs 36 billion (PSO Rs 26, PLL Rs 10 billion); (ii) July - Rs 42 billion (PSO Rs31 billion, PLL, Rs 11 billion);(iii) August - rs69 billion (PSO Rs 52 billion, PLL Rs 17 billion); and (iv) September - Rs 63 billion (PSO 46 billion, PLL Rs 17 billion). The liquidity shortfall is likely to happen due to two reasons, i.e., delayed payments by CPPA to SNGPL on account of RLNG supply to power plants (only 28% of payments have been received from CPPA in May 2022 against the invoices raised) and secondly due to delay in income tax refund to SNGPL, etc., resulting in further delay in payment to PSO and PLL. The shortfall will aggravate the prevailing liquidity crunch of SNGPL, PSO and PLL making fuel supply chain vulnerable.  Petroleum Division has claimed that the ECC, in its decision of May 11, 2018 and June 6, 2020 allowed SNGPL to divert LNG during winter months to domestic consumers having much lower tariff while OGRA was directed to allow recovery of RLNG diversion cost/ tariff differential through monthly RLNG pricing. OGRA has maintained its stance that Government may consider to fund the tariff differential in respect of diversion of RLNG and it does not appear fair and equitable to cross-subsidize RLNG consumers. Therefore, recovery of diversion cost of RLNG is still outstanding and as of April, 2202 an amount of Rs. 162 billion has accumulated impacting SNGPL\u2019s ability to pay to PSO and PLL against RLNG supply. Petroleum Division, in its proposal has requested that in order to maintain the sustainability of the LNG supply chain, as well as, import petroleum products in the country, supplementary allocation/ TSG of Rs 36 billion for June 2022 may be approved under the head of Petroleum Division. The allocated amount shall be released to SNGPL against pending claims in respect of cost of the RLNG diversion to domestic sector for setting off the payable of PSO and PPL against RLNG supply.  Petroleum Division further requested that liquidity requirement of Rs 171 billion for the months of July-September 2022 may also be approved. Finance Ministry has supported the summary to the extent of a TSG/ SG of Rs.36 billion. However, having no fiscal space for the proposed allocation of Rs. 174 billion in the next financial year\u2019s budget, Finance Division has not support the proposal.

The Finance Ministry maintains that during a number of meetings held in Finance Division, attended by the key Ministries and SOEs, it was agreed by the SOEs that BESOS amount will be settled through cash deposit or non-cash adjustment. However, the action by the concerned is still awaited. According to sources, the Finance Division has maintained that it is under significant fiscal pressure to meet the budgetary shortfall during CFY, urging Ministries that concerned SOEs may be directed to deposit the BESOS balance in Federal Consolidated Fund immediately. On April 22, 2022, Secretary PC, Hassan Nasir Jamy in a letter to Secretary Finance, cited the reference of his earlier letter of February 14, 2022 wherein the short order of October 22, 2020 passed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the appeals titled C.A.421/2018, 422/2018 & 423/2018 in which the Benazir Employees Stock Option Scheme was declared unconstitutional, was highlighted.  He said, in various meetings held in the Finance Division with the concerned Ministries/Entities such as OGDCL and PPL, etc, the entities argued that the amounts cannot be transferred in the Consolidated Fund of the federal government in the absence of the detailed order to be passed by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has now passed the detailed order declaring BESOS as a scheme executed in breach of Article 154 of the constitution. The operative para of the detailed order is as follows:  \u201cin view of our discussion above, where the very scheme has been found to be against Article 154 of the Constitution, we set aside the judgment of November 24, 2016 passed by the Islamabad High Court in ICA| No. 292 to 294 of 2016 and uphold the judgment of January 3, 2018 passed by the High Court of Sindh in Constitution petition No. 1837 of 2014.\u201d \u201cPrivatisation Commission through its legal wing had vigorously pursued the case in the Supreme Court of Pakistan leading to the final decision in favour of Government of Pakistan that may result in an addition of over Rs.30 billion in the Consolidated Fund,\u201d said Secretary PC. According to Jamy, the Central Revolving Fund maintained by Privatisation Commission has been closed since, 2020 and all concerned Ministries have already been requested through PC\u2019s OM of December 30, 2020 to deposit amount retained on account of Employees Empower Trust (EET) in the Federal Consolidated Fund. Secretary PC has requested Finance Division to issue following necessary directions to the concerned Ministries/Entities: (i) transfer of amounts in EET directly in the Federal Consolidated Fund maintained by the Finance Division pursuant to the decision of Federal Cabinet on March 29, 2019; and (ii) winding up or revocation of EET\u2019s as may be advised by the Law and Justice Division in the light of the order passed by the Supreme Court in this regard.

According to the Finance Division, the Federal Cabinet, on the directives of the then President, in its meeting held on August 5, 2009 approved BESOS, offering 12 per cent of GoP share to the employees of 80 State Owned Entities as an arrangement to empower the employees. The scheme envisaged that 12 per cent of GoP share of amount received from dividends was to be divided into two options - 50 per cent to be credited to Central Revolving Fund (CRF) maintained by the Privatisation Commission which was to be used for payments of buyback claims on the pre-defined criteria; and 50 per cent was kept by the EETs for distribution amongst the employees of respective entities.

The committee was informed that 26 days\u2019 stock is already available and stock for the next month is also secured.  The chairman committee lamented the fact that PARCO and Attock oil refineries do not supply diesel and all the onus is on the PSO for the supply of diesel. The chairman committee recommended sharing the burden of PSO for the supply of diesel and taking practical steps to resolve the issue of the shortage of high speed diesel as the harvesting season is fast approaching.  The ministry officials apprised the committee that in order to avert any shortage in the market it needs to give confidence to the OMCs that the price differential shall be promptly paid. The committee was also informed that expected PDC for 1-15th March is Rs883 million rupees; however, in subsequent fortnights it is expected to be around Rs30 billion rupees depending upon international oil prices. The committee observed the government is giving Rs20-22 billion in the shape of cross subsidy annually. 19 percent gas consumption by fertilisers and 21percent gas by the Power Division is also consumed annually. The committee received a comprehensive briefing from the Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division) on the government\u2019s strategy and plans to handle the oil import and prices in the current scenario of Russia-Ukraine Conflict.  The Committee was apprised that the prime minister announced a relief package on 28th February 2022. There will be a reduction in the consumer price of Motor Spirit (MS) and High Speed Diesel (HSD) by Rs10 per litre. It has also been committed to keep the prices stable till the end of the fiscal year. Petroleum Levy will be Rs1.81/liter on Motor Spirit and zero on HSD.  The committee was also informed that price differential of Rs2.28/liter on HSD will be paid to the oil marketing companies/ refineries. It was also informed that the OMC\u2019s refineries may need higher working capital limits on account of Price Differential Claims (PDC).  The committee was informed that the mitigation efforts also include the ECC approved budget of Rs20 billion with quick mechanism to pay PDC to OMCs/ refineries through OGRA and PSO within seven days after each fortnight.  A total of five cargoes of 27, through long-term G2G supplier \u2013Kuwait Petroleum Corporation - are expected in March and the remaining in April this year. The Senate Standing Committee also discussed the plans of the government to reduce and pay\u2013off the circular debt in gas sector at length.  The ministry lamented that the companies are a victim of government\u2019s policy to subsidize gas. The committee was briefed that the new laws have been enacted empowering the OGRA to notify the sale price already determined if the governments does not give timely advise on the prices within a period of 40 days.  The new law has also enabled the ORGA to revise the gas prices.  The average consumer price in 2021 was Rs314 (selling price) at a cost of Rs758.  The committee was informed that sales prices are not proportionally revised, resulting in rising differential.  The increasing domestic gas consumer\u2019s share resulted in lower cross subsidisation by higher paying sectors. The ministry briefed that circular debt (CD) is the outcome of policy choices by the GoP through sub-optimal cross subsidization. The GoP cannot keep both industry and domestic sector happy at the same time. The chairman committee proposed recommendations that the CNG import should be allowed by either the PLL or the CNG private stakeholders, themselves, rather than the government through the process of diversions, so that the burden on the government in the supply of gas can be shared and the issue of circular debt can also be resolved. The committee was also briefed on the reasons for reduction in PLL\u2019s Quantum of LNG imports including the unprecedented high spot market prices.  The committee was briefed that the PPL received approximately 143 billion rupees. Other reasons include problems related to credit security limitations and non-supply by term suppliers, the ministry informed. Senate Committee on Petroleum took up the issue of provision of gas facility to Sirikot, Tehsil Ghazi, district Haripur. The committee was informed that supply of gas to union council Sirikot was approved by the federal cabinet and the required government funding (direct) was credited in Assignment Account during 2018, but the work on the project could not commence in wake of general elections and the funds lapsed by the end of the financial year.

The ministry informed that the government is reviewing expansion in domestic sector, improvement in gas supplies and removal of pricing distortion.   Matters pertaining to the oil and gas fields, wherein, section-4 has not been imposed, and details of acquisition of land and rent being paid to the land owners in Balochistan were presented.  Senator Sabir Shah raised question as to how can any private individual who does not legally own any land is charging rent to a state-owned firm.  The committee was briefed that in Balochistan, all land acquisition by Mari Petroleum Company Limited (MPCL) for its projects is done under section 161 of Balochistan Land Revenue Act, 1967 and that there is no land directly leased to landowners.  The chairman committee directed that chief secretaries be summoned on the issue and the concerned deputy commissioners should brief the committee on the matter. The issue of gas load-shedding, licensing and non\u2013establishment of LPG plants in Panjgur, raised by Senator Danesh Kumar was considered in detail.  The committee was apprised that there is no ban on construction/ installation of LPG plants all over Pakistan and licenses are being granted, to each and every applicant who fulfils requirement of Mineral and Industrial Gases Safety Rules, 2010.  The committee was also briefed that the SSGCL is trying its level best to serve all its consumers to the best of its ability prioritizing domestic sector despite, depletion in indigenous gas supplies by nine pc per annum.  The committee was also informed that the Economic Coordination Committee of the Cabinet (ECC) on 26th March 2020 had decided to shelve the installation of all LPG Air Mix Plants including the one in Panjgur.

While phasing out of furnace oil is the right decision, it has left refineries distressed. Part of it has to do with inadequate refining capacity and no upgrade in the refining process. Attock Group has two refineries: National Refinery Limited (PSX: NRL) and Attock Refinery Limited (PSX: ATRL), both demonstrating a sloppy earning position. The refineries posted 9MFY19 financial performance recently, where ATRL saw its earnings go down from a profit of Rs1.23 billion in 9MFY18 to a loss of over Rs3 billion in 9MFY19. Similarly, NRL posted a loss of Rs5.19 billion in 9MFY19 versus a profit of Rs1.57 billion in 9MFY18. The situation in 3QFY19 worsened as ATRL\u2019s losses increased by 68 percent, year-on-year, while NRL\u2019s losses in the quarter increased by more than 20 times that of 3QFY18. Where up-liftment of furnace oil has remained a challenge, the decline in refineries\u2019 profitability is also due to higher crude oil prices in the beginning of the fiscal year and thus higher product prices, squeezing the gross refining margins. In the second half, substantial decline in crude oil prices resulted in inventory losses. The overall performance of the refineries was also impacted by the currency depreciation that wreaked havoc on net margins overall, as the refineries incurred high exchange losses in the first two quarters of FY19. For Attock Refinery Limited, the non-refinery income could also not contain the losses. And for NRL, the lube segment could not save the overall profitability of the refinery due to asymmetrical increase in prices of lube products and also lower sales volume of bitumen amid lower development activity in the country. The government has planned to give a 5-year window to the existing refineries as well with similar concessions offered to new refineries to upgrade. In a recent interview with BR Research, Nadeem Babar, Chairman Energy Reforms Taskforce pointed out that the plan is that the refineries will export furnace oil for the next two years where the government will give them some financial incentive in the first six months- as FO is a negative margins product due to import price parity \u2013 after which they will have to compete on their own or go to deeper conversions.

Not only did the coronavirus pandemic in the 2HFY20 hit the sector hard, slower economic growth in the fiscal year leading to lower overall petroleum consumption, the furnace oil crisis and crashing oil prices also weighed heavy on the sector\u2019s profitability. But apart from these exogenous factors, the state of the refineries in the country and their inability to upgrade all these years has been a key factor in the debilitating downstream oil refining sector.  Atock Groups\u2019 two refineries - Attock Refinery Limited (PSX: ATRL) and National Refinery Limited (PSX: NRL) are part of the only four listed refineries. Profitability of these refineries has nose-dived, and the earnings continued to run into losses in FY20 after a weak FY19. The only positive thing about FY20 performance is that their losses halved on a year on year basis.  Attock Refinery posted a loss after tax of Rs2.8 billion, which was lower by 48 percent year-on-year from FY19. And National Refinery Limited, which is also a lube refinery posted a loss after tax of over Rs4 billion for FY20, which was 53 percent year-on-year lower than the losses incurred in FY19. While the revenues of the two refineries continued to fall, the decline in losses for ATRL stemmed primarily from over 80 percent decline in finance cost. However, for NRL, a look at loss before tax shows that the losses increased by over 35 percent year-on-year in FY20 despite a decline in finance cost. A key issue for the two refineries has been the FO upliftment and reduction in its price in FY20. And then the impact on operations because of COVID-19 and the related restrictions in the country.  Attock refinery had to reduce its capacity to minimum (around 20-30%), while NRL was forced to halt operations and close the refinery temporarily during the year.

Taking part in the debate, the members belonging to treasury were all praise for their government, saying a tax-free budget at a time when the country is facing a pandemic is commendable. The opposition members kept reminding their fellow MPs from treasury not to take refuge under the Covid-19 pandemic from the failures of their party's government arguing the novel coronavirus started just a few months ago. Taking part in the debate, opposition Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) MNA Ayesha Ghous Pasha said that for the first time in the history of the country, there was no revised estimate of the outgoing year in the budgeting brief. She contended that budget deficit was 10.1 and the government claim that it was 9.1, was misleading, adding it was a willful attempt to hide the tax mobilization target. She said that this year, the government claimed the budget deficit would be 9.1 percent of the GDP, but it was 10.1 percent, and they know it because they had stated two things wrongly. She said that the \"revenue was set to go down from the 80 billion i.e. 0.2 percent of the GDP\", adding the total deficit of all four provincial governments would be 80 billion. \"So the IMF report says budget deficit of all four provinces is going to be 209 billion, so in the budgeting brief, it's clearly written the budget deficit of the province is 393 billion [and] to hide its budget deficit, they're hiding the provincial deficit, so this budget is not 9.1 as it is 10.1,\" she added. Another PML-N MNA Rana Sanaullah came down hard on the government, and said the government should be ashamed of itself for presenting such a budget where there was no relief for the poor. \"The government has completely destroyed the economy and failed to fulfill all its promises made with the masses before coming into power,\" he added.

The issue of existing refineries is very serious as they faced financial losses of approximately Rs 50 billion during the last two years. Refineries faced inventory losses due to rupee devaluation and then Covid-19 put additional financial pressure on them. Presently, the margins of refineries remain negative. The government wants that refineries should upgrade themselves, which needs to be done, but for this purpose, an investment of $ 6-7 billion is required so that they can make products of Euro-V fuel. During the visit of Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad Bin Salman, it was announced that Aramco will establish a refinery and a petrochemical plant in Pakistan with an investment of $ 10 billion. Likewise, PARCO announced it would establish a coal refinery but both have linked their investment to a new refinery policy. The existing five refineries have capacity of 417,400 Barrels Per Day (BPD), of which Pak Arab Refinery Limited (PARCO) has 100,000 BPD oil refining capacity, Attock Refinery Limited (ARL) 53,400 BPD, Byco Petroleum Pakistan Limited (Byco) 150,000 BPD, National Refinery Limited (NRL) 64,000 BPD and Pakistan Refinery Limited 50,000 BPD. The present refinery policy was announced and notified in 1997 and not updated during the last two decades. \"Negotiations with the government are in progress on new refinery policy. It will give protection to new investment which is necessary,\" the sources continued. An investment of $ 15 billion is envisaged through establishment of two new refineries and upgradation of existing refineries. \"Talks with government are going towards positive direction. Now there is a feeling in the government that energy security is being jeopardized in the absence of a new refinery policy,\" the sources continued. The government had prepared a policy in 2020 offering substantial incentives to the investors but the existing refineries rejected the policy and urged the government to review it. Since then refineries are getting incentives under the Refineries and Marketing Policy of 1997. On the advice and financial difficulties of the local refineries, the Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division) had formed a \u2018Refinery Working Group\u2019 to work out different plans for mitigating refinery losses and formulate a comprehensive policy framework for future refinery expansion and upgrade.   In the refineries policy 2020, the following incentives were offered to the refineries: new refinery projects and upgradation and expansion of existing refineries under Category A shall be exempted from the application of the Companies Profit (Workers\u2019 Participation) Act 1968 and the Workers Welfare Fund Ordinance 1971; and exemption  from all duties, taxes, surcharges and levies on import, by the refinery project, its contractors or any other person, of all machinery, vehicles, plant and equipment, other materials and spares and consumables for setting up of operation, maintenance  and repair of the refinery. A number of other incentives were also offered to attract investment.

It is a subsidiary of the Attock Oil Company Limited (AOC). Its product portfolio includes crude oil and natural gas, and it also produces LPG that it markets under its brand name POLGAS as well as its subsidiary, CAPGAS (Private) Limited. POL also produces solvent oil and Sulphur and has a vast pipeline network for transporting the crude oil to the group\u2019s refinery, and its associate company: Attock Refinery Limited (ATRL).  More than half of the company\u2019s shareholding rests with the Attock Oil Company (AOC), which is the group. A category-wise breakup of the shareholding is shown in the illustration. Besides Attock Refinery Limited, POL\u2019s other associate companies include National Refinery (NRL), Attock Petroleum Limited (APL), Attock Cement Limited, Attock Gen. Limited, and Attock Information Technology Services. POL has been an oil heavy company where its crude oil revenues have accounted for over 55-60 percent in the past, while natural gas has accounted for 20-25 percent of the total sales; A look back at FY15 shows that even though the company witnessed positive growth on the volume side especially that of crude oil, POL suffered at the hands of declining crude oil prices; At the same time higher exploration and prospecting expenditure further axed the profits for the year.  The company\u2019s revenue growth in FY16 remianed constrained as the oil prices touched historic lows, which also impacted the bottomline that declined by 14 percent, year-on-year. But unlike FY15 where the firm showed positive growth in production volumes, FY16 was marred with slowing down production by around 2-3 percent. This time however, some respite to the bottomline came from lower exploration and prospecting expenditure.  FY17 was a better year for the E&P sector as the oil prices rebounded and POL\u2019s revenues and earnings were up by 10 percent and 34 percent, year-on-year respectively after continuously declining for the two years. Where exploration costs remained under control POL witnessed a drop in production flows from its key Tal block.  FY18 was successful for POL in terms of new finds and operations. In FY18, POL made four new exploratory successes. Three of its development wells were also successful in the fiscal year. Revenues climbed by over 19 percent, and earnings grew by 17.6 percent, year-on-year. Growth in the topline came from better crude oil prices as well as highest crude oil production in the company\u2019s 10-year history. Exploration costs remained on the higher side for POL in FY18 due to seismic acquisition of Balkassar Lease, DG Khan and Gurgalot block, and dry and abandoned wells and some irrecoverable costs. What was an added factor to company\u2019s profitability in FY18 was the in exchange gains due to depreciating currency.  FY19 was outlined as a better year for the oil and gas exploration and production companies not only because of higher average oil prices, but also a significant domestic currency devaluation. Both these factors were key drivers for earnings accretion for the E&P companies in FY19. POL also saw its topline grow by 25 percent, year-on-year, which came from around 14 percent year-on-year increase in international crude oil prices. On the other hand, volumetric sales remained tepid especially of crude oil with only slight increase in gas volumes. POL\u2019s earnings for FY19 jumped by 48 percent, year-on-year; and apart from topline growth, lower exploration and prospecting costs and almost double other income helped lift the company\u2019s bottomline. The main factor behind lower exploration and prospecting was the absence of a dry well and also lower seismic acquisition. And other income increased due to currency devaluation.  FY20 was marred by COVID-19 and the lockdown, as well as the crash in oil prices which were key reasons for slowing earnings growth for the oil and gas exploration and production sector. Overall, POL\u2019s revenues came down by 13 percent, year-on-year, where the 4QFY20 saw a 48 percent decline in sales revenue. The decline in revenue was due to falling volumetric sales as well as oil prices. During FY20, oil and gas production for POL plummeted by 13 and 9 percent year-on-year, respectively, while the average oil prices tumbled by 25-26 percent year-on-year. On the expense side, exploration and prospecting expenditure remained lower in FY20 due to the absence of any dry well during the year. With lower interest rates during, other income and finance costs also decline for POL. POL\u2019s earnings in FY20 were hence flat. During the first nine-months of FY20, the company posted a growth of over 24 percent year-on-year in its earnings, showing that the fourth quarter (4QFY20) was a drag on the bottomline.  The earnings growth depends largely on international oil prices to pick up as production volumes have been diminishing in the E&P sector for quite some time.  Amid falling reserves, and fewer as well as small discoveries in a low crude oil price environment FY21 started off weakfor the oil and gas sector. Decline in production flows has been a key factor for falling revenues for the sector. POL\u2019s revenues for 9MFY21 slipped by 13 percent year-on-year with 3QFY21 topline receding by 8 percent. While the 3QFY21 has been better in terms of oil prices that witnessed a recovery year-on-year, the production stats were weak with oil and gas production down by around 5 and 7 percent year-on-year. The decline in Pakistan Oilfields Limited\u2019s (PSX: POL) earnings was 31 percent year-on-year during 9MFY21. POL\u2019s profitability was also affected by decrease in other income likely due to higher quantum of exchange losses.  Going forward, the fourth quarter is likelyto fare better for the oil andgas exploration and production sector due to jump in crude oil prices.

Petroleum Division has submitted that the matter of deemed duty has already been discussed in the CCoE\u2019s meeting held on September 13, 2021 while considering the Petroleum Division\u2019s summary on the Pakistan Oil Refining Policy 2021 and CCoE approved the policy to the extent of establishment of new refineries whereas Petroleum Division was directed to present workable option for sustainability and up-gradation of existing refineries. CCoE also required further clarity on the utilization of revenue stream arising out of tariff protection (deemed duty) on offsetting of losses instead of up-gradation in the past. As a matter of fact the protection regime in the refining sector has been in place since 1960s which has taken many forms concomitant to the emerging challenges of different times. The tariff protection formula (deemed duty) introduced in 2002 for the existing refineries was aimed at ensuring their operational sustainability. In order to ensure supply of quality products to the consumers, Government has been constantly improving the desired specifications of refinery products to remain aligned with global refinery market, as well as, international quality benchmarks. Improvement in product standards has led to the up-gradation of existing plants to remain commercially viable against the headwinds of import of oil products from international market.  Following is a brief chronology of improvement of product specifications by local refineries in Pakistan: (i) in 2000, enhancement of motor gasoline Research Octane Number (RON) from 80 to 87 RON; (ii) 2002, elimination of lead from Motor Gasoline; and (iii) 2016, enhancement of Motor Gasoline RON from 87 to 92 (Euro-Il).  According to Petroleum Division the next target is Euro-V Motor Gasoline which will be achieved in 2026.  Petroleum Division stated that prior to 2012 sales of diesel @ 1 per cent Sulphur content (10,000 ppm) was replaced with 0.5 per cent Sulphur content (5,000 ppm). In 2016, diesel was shifted to   0, 05 per cent Sulphur content (500 ppm) which will be 0.001 per cent in 2026 when Euro-V HSD will be introduced.  Resultantly, existing five refineries have constantly been upgrading their installed configuration\u2019s in compliance with new specifications and to compete with international suppliers in line with the tariff protection formula given in Budget speech on Finance Bill 2002 whereby refineries were required to operate and compete in the market on their own (without precondition for up-gradation), as quoted below: \u201cAs part of the restructuring and de-regulation of the oil sector the Ministry of Petroleum has decided to abolish the minimum 10% rate of return guarantee for the National Refinery Limited, Pakistan Refinery Limited and Attock Refinery Limited and allow them to compete in the market through tariff protection formula. For this purpose import duty at 10% ad valorem on import of HSD and 5% ad valorem plus 1% surcharge on import of kerosene oil, light diesel oil and JP-4 is being proposed. However, excise duty on these products is being abolished and petroleum development levy is being reduced to minimize the impact of this measure on the retail prices. While conveying the formula to the refineries, the refineries were issued guidelines by the Petroleum Division on June 25, 2002 that 50% of the net profit after tax will be diverted to a special reserve account to offset against any future loss or make investment for expansion or up-gradation of refinery. According to Petroleum Division, the intent of 2002 tariff protection policy was to provide a reasonable margin to refineries so that refineries could primarily operate their normal business while encouraging them to manage losses and up-grade refineries with the provision of a special reserve account. Accordingly, refineries have run the operation of refineries on their own and also up-graded the same during 2002-2020. The focus of the proposed Refining Policy 2021 is also to up-grade and enhance the production/ quality of the local fuel so as to minimize dependency on import. Petroleum Division argues that in addition refineries not only made investments and up-graded the refineries in the past with the provision of special reserve account but also have arranged funds out of their own resources and borrowings. A brief position on the collection andutilization of deemed duty since inception onwards is as follows: (i) Pak Arab Refinery (PARCO) spent Rs66 billion against collection of Rs76 billion; (ii) Attock Refinery Ltd Rs26  billion against collection of Rs47 billion; (iii) National Refinery Ltd Rs37 billion as compared to collection of Rs40 billion; (iv) Pakistan Refinery Ltd, Rs 17 billion against collection of Rs 36 billion; and (v) Byco Petroleum Pakistan Ltd Rs53 billion against collection of Rs38 billion. The details of financial audit, conducted by refineries since inception through reputed independent audit firm have also been shared. Auditor General of Pakistan Office also reviewed the details of the deduction/ utilization of deemed duty for the period 2002-2018. In addition, ENAR Petrotech Services Ltd also carried out technical audit in 2016 on the direction of Petroleum Division in order to assess whether refineries have up-gradated their plants by installing Naptha Isomerization and Diesel Hydro-Desulphurization unit. Petroleum Division has argued that it is clear that refineries have up-graded their plants by using deemed duty as well as their own resources, and undertook its financial technical audit.

The PSO braves the loss of Rs6.089 billion in the import of LNG because of the exchange rate loss. The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has so far failed to clear the PSO dues, which have jacked up to Rs21.945 billion.  In addition, the PSO is also required to be paid Rs9.282 billion under the head of price deferential claims from the government and Rs4.920 billion under the head of exchange rate differential on the foreign exchange loan.  Coming to the payables, the data unfolds that the PSO payables have soared to Rs177.459 billion because of the deteriorating cash flow situation on account of non-recovery of its dues amounting to over Rs374 billion.  The PSO's inability to clear its outstanding liabilities has been compromised, which is why its payables have increased to Rs148.366 billion under the head of letter of credits, with regard to payments to the KPC (Kuwait Petroleum Company) and a standby letter of credit for LNG imports. The PSO has so far failed to pay Rs24.359 billion to five refineries, which are already running in huge losses.  It is required to pay to the PARCO (Pak-Arab Refinery Company) Rs12.557 billion, PRL (Pakistan Refinery Limited) Rs4.414 billion, NRL (National Refinery Limited) Rs2.469 billion, ARL (Attock Refinery Limited) Rs3.692 billion, and ENAR Rs1.227 billion. Still PSO is to assert its dominance in the energy market as it outperforms the industry, demonstrating its resilience and strength despite the lingering impacts of the pandemic. The market leader reported an all-time high net profit after tax of PKR 11.9 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021-22 a growth of 133 percent compared to the same period last year.  The PSO's aggressive market penetration and growth strategy resulted in an increase in market share across its diverse portfolios, achieving substantial volumetric growth compared to the same period last year.  A cumulative volume growth of 22.4 percent in white oil and 40.5 percent in black oil was witnessed during the period.  The company's market share increased by 2.1 percent in white oil to 47.7 percent and by 8.0 percent in black oil to 64.5 percent.  The PSO continued to fast track infrastructural projects to gain operational efficiency and expand its business, adding 13 new outlets to the company's extensive retail footprint, while also working on rehabilitation and new storages.

The PSO\u2019s receivables from all the clients touched Rs402.863 billion.  The PSO has recovered Rs194.283 billion from the power sector along with late payment surcharge income.  At present, the PSO is to recover Rs402.863 billion from its clients.  The company management has reduced finance cost by Rs3.2 billion that had further complemented the profitability of the company.  However, it is still facing a critical time due to all-time high receivables. The PSO supplies oil to various clients and now a new phenomenon in the shape of circular debt has emerged on account of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Of the total, the PSO has to receive Rs194.283 billion from the power sector on account of oil supply for power generation. Generation companies are major defaulters that have to pay Rs140.714 billion.  Hubco owes Rs45.105 billion, whereas, Kapco has to pay Rs8.465 billion. The PSO has also played a pivotal role in the LNG sector.  The company entered into another agreement with Qatar Petroleum under G2G arrangement to supply an additional three million tons of LNG for a period of 10 years. This contract shall add additional volumes to an already executed 15-year long-term sales purchase agreement (SPA), making the PSO the largest supplier of LNG in the country with a supply base of 6.75 million tons per annum. However, the company is facing circular debt issue in this sector.  It is supplying LNG to the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) to distribute to the consumers. The SNGPL has to pay Rs164.759 billion to the PSO on account of LNG supply.  This is a new addition in the circular debt chain in the oil and gas sectors. The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) is another big defaulter of PSO. The PSO supplies jet fuel to the airline to continue its operations.  However, it has not been able to pay dues to PSO on account of fuel supply. The PIA has to pay Rs21.974 billion to the PSO.  The state-run oil company is due to receive Rs10.161 billion from the government on account of price differential claims. Despite multibillion rupees of the PSO being stuck due to non-payment of dues by its clients, it has been making major payments to oil refineries in Pakistan. The PSO has to pay Rs32.101 billion to oil refineries.  It owes Rs16.836 billion to Pak-Arab Refinery Company (Parco), Rs4.931 billion to Pakistan Refinery Limited (PRL), Rs3.984 billion to National Refinery Limited (NRL), Rs3.848 billion to Attock Refinery Limited (ARL), Rs1.100 billion to Byco, and Rs1.403 billion Enar. The PSO is also the largest importer of oil.  It has an agreement with Kuwait Petroleum.  It has to pay the company Rs129 billion on account of LC payments for oil and LNG. The financial results have demonstrated the PSO\u2019s agility and strength across its diverse portfolio despite, the challenging economic scenario and recurrent waves of the pandemic. The PSO is leading the market by a large margin, delivering a phenomenal performance over and above the industry average. Despite swelling outstanding, the company has exhibited an outstanding growth of 21.9 percent in liquid fuels over last year with volumes reaching 9.2 million tons, attaining a market share of 46.3 percent in financial year 2021 compared to 44.3 percent in financial year 2020-21. The PSO also achieved its highest-ever volume of 7.6 million tons in the white oil segment despite, the shrinking jet fuel and kerosene oil industry, with a market share of 45.2 percent in financial year 2021 compared to 44 percent in financial year 2020.

Drivers of auto rickshaws and taxis were seen refusing to give services to their customers due to shortage of fuel in the city, and some were charging heavily on customers, citing the current petrol crisis. Chairman PPDA Abdul Sami Khan told Business Recorder that the strike remained successful and would continue as long as the government does not honour its commitment to increase the margins of the dealers. He said government has not yet resolved our grievances. When asked about negotiations with the government to resolve the issue, he said: \u201cI am not in a position to say anything about this, for the time being.\u201d He said except some 20 fuel stations owned and operated by a couple of OMCs, the rest of 480 plus fuel stations of Karachi alone remained closed on Thursday. On the other hand, the Federal Energy Minister Hammad Azhar took to twitter as saying: \u201cMost of the PSO pumps are open now, and more will be open by evening. Large companies-operated pumps are also open. We are in touch with the Petroleum Dealers Association.

He said his association has transported some 6,000, and 3000 fuel tankers across four provinces and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively from Karachi. \u201cWe will dispatch 5,000 more oil carriers to various cities on Friday,\u201d Shams said, adding APTOA has distanced itself from the strike of PPDA. Abdul Sami Khan, while addressing a press conference at Karachi Press Club (KPC) the other day, had said that PPDA had demanded six percent margin for the dealer from present 2.5 percent. The PPDA had announced to go on strike on November 05, 2021, as well. He pointed out that the federal government had invited the dealers association to come to Islamabad. In the said meeting the matter was discussed in details and the government authorities agreed to margin of the dealers, but to no avail.

Imports stood at $ 6.052 billion in June 2021 as compared to $ 2.333 billion in corresponding month of 2020, showing an enormous growth of 62.7 per cent.    However, merchandise exports have crossed $ 25 billion in FY 2020-21 as compared to $ 21.394 in FY 2019-20, posting a growth of 18.2 per cent. Pakistan\u2019s exports in 2013-14 stood at $ 25.121 whereas exports were $ 25.294, in FY 2020-21, or just an increase of a few million dollars, with 42 percent tariff rationalization and other fiscal incentives.   In June, 2021, exports constituted a growth of 70 per cent - $ 2.718 billion against $ 1.119 billion in June 2020.  The trade deficit in June 2021 grew by 57.2 per cent. The export of services is expected to be $ 6 billion in FY 2020-21.     Addressing a press conference, Prime Minister Advisor on Commerce and Investment, Abdul Razak Dawood, flanked with Secretary Commerce, Sualeh Ahmad Faruqui, shared details of exports performance of FY 2020-21, rationalization in custom tariffs and his scheduled visit to Uzbekistan on July 15, 2021, during which both countries are scheduled to sign a transit trade agreement. Dawood commended the role of exporters for achieving $ 25 billion mark, with a growth of 18 per cent at a time when the entire world is facing difficult situation due to Covid-19. \u201cThis is a remarkable achievement by our exporters considering the difficulties created by Covid-19 at home and resultant contractions in our major markets. It was not an easy task as many countries went into lock down, which severely affected business,\u201d he said, adding that not only Pakistani exporters survived the crisis but also enhanced exports in many sectors. Dawood and Secretary Commerce brushed aside criticism on the performance of Commerce Ministry and Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP), saying both the Ministry and TDAP are playing their roles in export growth.   He said tariffs have been rationalized on more than 4,000 tariff lines in the last 18 months out of a total of 7,300 tariff lines the revenue impact of which was around Rs 40-50 billion.  In budget 2021-22, Additional Customs Duty (ACD) has been reduced from 7 per cent to 6 per cent on items currently subject to 20 per cent customs duty slab. Razak Dawood maintained that tariff should not be increased for revenue enhancement, adding that three or four years are required to complete tariff rationalization process. He said import of 42 per cent raw material is now duty fee.              He said, textile exports have posted a growth of 18.85 per cent during FY 2020-21, whereas 27 percent growth in exports was recorded in pharmaceuticals. However, export of rice has shown a negative growth of 8 per cent, followed by cotton yarn 2 per cent, leather 16 per cent and plastic 6 per cent. In reply to a question, Mr. Dawood said that Pakistan wants to sign a new Afghanistan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement (APTTA) and Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA).  Answering another questionm he said that the government is in touch with the European Union (EU) with respect to implementation status of 27 Conventions. \u201cThere is no major issue with the EU as Pakistan has already implemented 22 Conventions out of 27,\u201d he maintained.

Treasury bills and PIBs have offered steady risk-free returns as credit appetite has been slow to grow, despite some uptick of late. The bank saw its investment portfolio grow 30 percent over December 2020, crossing the trillion-rupee mark. Effective tenor management in line with interest rate dynamics has been the order of the day. The advances portfolio, on the other hand saw a rather muted growth of 4 percent over December 2020.

Attock Oil Company is vertically integrated oil Conglomerate Company. A category-wise breakup of the shareholding is shown in the illustration. Besides Attock Refinery Limited, POL\u2019s other associate companies include National Refinery (NRL), Attock Petroleum Limited (APL), Attock Cement Limited, Attock Gen. Limited, and Attock Information Technology Services. Pakistan Oilfields Limited has mostly been an oil-heavy company. A look at the company\u2019s past six years show that POL\u2019s revenue growth in FY16was constrained as the oil prices touched historic lows at that time, which also impacted the bottomline that fell by 14 percent, year-on-year. The E&P company\u2019s volumetric growth was also affected by slowing down production by around 2-3 percent. However, lower exploration and prospecting expenditure partially offset the decline in profits. FY17 turned out better as the oil prices recovered. POL\u2019s revenues and earnings were up by 10 percent and 34 percent, year-on-year respectively after declining in the two previous years. However, the company\u2019s production flows again dropped during the year. On the other hand, exploration costs remained under control. The company registered an improvement inFY18 as POL made new discoveries and new exploratory successes. Three of its development wells were also successful in the fiscal year. Revenues climbed by over 19 percent, and earnings grew by 17.6 percent, year-on-year. Growth in revenues came from better crude oil prices as well as the highest crude oil production in the last decade. Exploration costs remained on the higher side due to higher operational activity, seismic data acquisition, and also dry and abandoned wells. The firm\u2019s bottomline benefitted with exchange gains due to depreciating currency. FY19 was another year for higher oil prices. And significant domestic currency devaluation also bolstered the earnings for the company. POL\u2019s topline grew by 25 percent, year-on-year, which came from around 14 percent year-on-year increase in international crude oil prices. However, volumetric sales remained tepid especially that of crude oil with only slight increase in gas volumes. POL\u2019s earnings for FY19 jumped by 48 percent, year-on-year; and apart from oil prices, lower exploration and prospecting costs and higher currency depreciation helped lift the company\u2019s bottomline. The main factor behind lower exploration and prospecting was the absence of a dry well and also lower seismic acquisition. FY20 was marred by COVID-19 and the lockdown, as well as the crash in oil prices which were the key factors for slower growth in earnings of the oil and gas exploration and production sector. POL\u2019s revenues came down by 13 percent, year-on-year, where the 4QFY20 saw a 48 percent decline in sales revenue \u2013 a period when the pandemic struck the country. The decline in revenue was due to falling volumetric sales as well as oil prices. During FY20, oil and gas production for POL plummeted by 13 and 9 percent year-on-year, respectively, while the average oil prices tumbled by 25-26 percent year-on-year. Exploration and prospecting expenditure remained lower in FY20 due to the absence of any dry well during the year. With lower interest rates during the year, other income and finance costs also decline for POL. POL\u2019s earnings in FY20 were hence flat. FY2\u2019s highlight remained slow hydrocarbon production as well as weak international crude oil prices. These factors along with exchange losses affected the sector\u2019s profitability in FY21 including POL. Overall, POL\u2019s revenues in FY21 were flattish, declining by one percent year-on-year. The company\u2019s earnings were lower by around 18 percent year-on-year primarily due to exchange loss, lower income on bank deposits and higher taxation due to lesser exploration and development cost. During the year, production of crude oil and gas were lower by 0.77 percent and 2.5 percent year-on-year, respectively, while LPG production was higher by 1.58 percent year-on-year. 9MFY22 performance for POL has been a mix of currency depreciation and oil prices due to elevated oil and global uncertainty. FY22 saw record high crude oil prices due to Russia-Ukraine tensions as well as supply concerns. POL\u2019s earrings in 9MFY22 were seen climbing by 83 percent year-on-year, which came primarily from the topline due to higher international crude oil prices. Revenues of the company grew by 37 percent year-on-year for 9MFY22 respectively. Oil prices were higher by 72 percent year-on-year in 9MFY22. Besides higher prices, currency depreciation of 11 percent also added to the topline. However weak production statistics during the period for oil and gas continued to curtail in the topline growth. Higher exploration and prospecting expenditure that increased by four times in 9MFY22 versus 9MFY21 was due to increased seismic activity. Finance costs also jumped. And other income witnessed a big incline due to exchange gains, which resulted in growth in other income of around 39 times year-on-year in 9MFY22.

The first lube refinery was commissioned in 1966 with designed capacity of 3,970,500 barrels per annum of crude processing and 533,400 barrels per annum of lube base oils. The second lube refinery was commissioned in 1985 and it started with a designed capacity of 700,000 tons per annum of lube base oils, which was expanded to 805,000 barrels per annum after a revamp in 2008. Two Lube refineries process reduced crude to produce LBO, Bitumen, Wax and other specialty products. Its BTX petrochemical plant was commissioned in 1979 with design capacity of 180,000 barrels per annum. NRL\u2019s hydro skimming fuel refinery began operating in 1977 with a designed capacity of 11,385,000 barrels per annum of crude processing. The refinery underwent two phases of upgradation which took the capacity to 18,603,000 barrels per annum of crude processing. NRL started its HSD Desulphurisation unit in 2007 to produce the desired quality diesel. In the same year, NRL also commissioned its Isomerisation Unit (Naphtha Block) with a capacity to process 6,793 BPSD of light Naphtha into petrol. As per the shareholding pattern for the year ended June 30, 2018, 51 percent of the shares are held by the associate companies that include Attock Refinery Limited (ATRL) and Pakistan Oilfields Limited (POL). The other significant shareholder is Islamic Development Bank Jeddah, holding around 15 percent of the total shares. Local general public holds around 16 percent. A break up of the shareholding is given in the table. NRL\u2019s financial performance over the years has fluctuated. Its revenues increased at an impressive rate from FY10-FY14, after which growth eroded due to falling prices of petroleum products amid the supply glut. Where revenues decided to come down post FY14, margins took a flight post FY14, reaching highest in FY15 as compared to the previous three years. The primary reason for the increase in refining margins was the improvement in margins of refined fuel products versus crude oil. Particularly in FY15, the company benefited from lower prices of crude oil as the company invested unutilised funds and gained interest income. At the same time, stable exchange rates helped improve profitability. NRL saw more reliability in profits coming from the lube segment. The earnings of the segment improved further in FY16. And the fuel segment after four difficult years turned profitable in FY16 versus loss in previous years. Improvement in profitability for NRL came from favourable margins between product prices and cost of crude and improved sales of HSD and Bitumen. In FY17, NRL saw its revenues climb once again and the fuel segment\u2019s profitability improved due to better margins in the international market as well as higher sales volumes by the firm. The net profit of the fuel segment for FY17 also included investment tax credit against investments in DHDS project. Profitability of the lube segment however, declined in FY17 mainly on account of higher feed cost and irregular increase in product prices. This dragged the overall margins. In FY17, NRL commissioned its Diesel Hydro Desulphurisation Project, to produce low sulphur (EURO II Standard) High Speed Diesel (HSD). NRL\u2019s earnings fell by 78 percent, year-on-year in FY18 due to losses incurred by the fuel segment versus a profit in FY17. Though the revenues were up by 27 percent, year-on-year, the company\u2019s profitability was affected by higher operating cost including depreciation on new units, exchange loss, custom duty on crude oil, and lower return on bank deposits, according to the Annual Report 2017-18. Increase in crude oil and product prices continued to affect the margins especially in case of fuel products. Also, exchange losses dampened the earnings. On the positive side, some respite came from elimination of price differential on HSD and higher revenue from increased production and sale motor gasoline \u2013 though these were not enough to contain the damage from the higher costs. The firm\u2019s performance in the lube segment remained stable. However, decline in production was witnessed due to the turnaround of lube II refinery along with lower demand for lube base oil in the country. Volatility in the oil prices, increase in product prices and sharp devaluation of currency remained key challenges for NRL in FY19. NRL incurred a loss in FY19 versus a profit in FY18. The fuel segment\u2019s losses increased in FY19 due to huge exchange losses, uneven product margins, custom duty paid on imported crude, and mark-up cost incurred on short term finance as per the annual report. The segment\u2019s revenues came under pressure due to furnace oil sales declined as demand decreased and shifted to RLNG. Sales of HSD also witnessed decreasing trend mainly due to overall decline in consumption across the country. The lube segment managed to earn profit albeit lower than FY18 levels. The margins in lube segment declined due to increase in feed cost and asymmetrical increase in products\u2019 prices \u2013 the company highlights in its annual report. Also, the company faced lower demand for Bitumen due to lesser road infrastructure development. NRL\u2019s performance in FY20 was affected not only by the bottlenecks in the refining industry but also the COVID pandemic. Refinery sector was among the worst hit industries as the operations became highly unviable due to lower upliftement. Overall, NRL\u2019s losses in FY20 were lower than FY19 due to the effects of prior tax years being recognized, which has partially offset the losses during the year. Where the fuel segment remained under pressure, the lube segment\u2019s profits increased due to increase in the sale of Bitumen, although lube base oil sales decreased by 24 percent year-on-year due to lower demand as well as turnaround of Lube-1 refinery. Due to lower sales, NRL witnessed overall hefty inventory losses and hence higher finance cost to finance it. FY21 posted some recovery for the global economy. And Pakistan also saw some sectors recovering in FY21. Oil prices and petroleum products recorded a gradual increase but the GRMs remained thin as the consumption remained below pre pandemic levels. NRL\u2019s posted a profit in FY21 versus losses in the previous couple of years, which was primarily due to the lube segment. The fuel segment posted a loss but significantly lower than FY20 levels due to lower inventory losses and slight improvement in gross refining margins. Margins further improved due to production of Euro-V standard HSD and profitability benefited from exchange gains. Lube segment\u2019s earnings increased due to better Bitumen sales (up by 19 percent year-on-year) and global lube base oil supply constraints easing during the year. Also the Lube-1 refinery upgradation and revamp resulted in increased capacity to 70,000 barrels per day from 65,050 barrels per day and enhanced production capacity of lube base oil by 5000 - 6000 MT per year. Also, export sales of Bitumen improved significantly as NRL exported three times more in FY21 versus FY20. The refinery segment is not out of the woods. Rather, the sector has been in trouble for a long time primarily due to the inability of the refining sector to upgrade the refining process. NRL in 1QFY22 earned a profit after tax versus a loss in 1QFY21. The fuels segment\u2019s loss however increased further by 36 percent year-on-year in 1QFY22 due to high exchange losses from the currency depreciation even though the company saw the demand for crude oil and petroleum products improving along with increasing petroleum product prices and slight improvement in GRMs. The lube segment earned a profit after tax in 1QFY22 versus a loss in 1QFY21 due to improvement in sales as economic activity rebounded during the period. Also the resumption of the Lube-1 refinery after revamp increased production and hence sales.

POL\u2019s revenues came down by 13 percent, year-on-year, where the 4QFY20 saw a 48 percent decline in sales revenue \u2013 a period when the pandemic struck the country. The decline in revenue was due to falling volumetric sales as well as oil prices. During FY20, oil and gas production for POL plummeted by 13 and 9 percent year-on-year, respectively, while the average oil prices tumbled by 25-26 percent year-on-year. Exploration and prospecting expenditure remained lower in FY20 due to the absence of any dry well during the year. With lower interest rates during the year, other income and finance costs also decline for POL. POL\u2019s earnings in FY20 were hence flat. Slow hydrocarbon production as well as weak international crude oil prices during most part of the year was the main higlight of FY21. These factors along with exchange losses affected the sector\u2019s profitability in FY21 including POL. Overall, POL\u2019s revenues in FY21 were flattish, declining by one percent year-on-year. The company\u2019s earnings were lower by around 18 percent year-on-year primarily due to exchange loss, lower income on bank deposits and higher taxation due to lesser exploration and development cost. During the year, production of crude oil and gas were lower by 0.77 percent and 2.5 percent year-on-year, respectively, while LPG production was higher by 1.58 percent year-on-year. FY22 started off on a higher note for the E&P sector as oil prices spiked. The rise in international crude oil prices drove earnings of the E&P companies in 1QFY22 along with significant currency depreciation. POL posted 27 percent rise in revenues and a 45 percent year-on-year growth in earnings. The increase in the E&P firm\u2019s topline resulted from an almost 70 percent increase in crude oil prices. At the same time, the currency depreciation also played its part in lifting the revenues for the 1QFY22. However, POL\u2019s oil and gas production declined by 11.3 percent and 9.1 percent year-on-year, while LPG was lower by 14 percent year-on-year during the year. There was also a hefty growth in exploration and prospecting expenditure - rising by 6 times in 1QFY22 versus 1QFY21 due to increased seismic activity. Finance costs also escalated by 17 times during the quarter. A concern for the oil and gas exploration and production sector is weakness in production volumes. Where oil and gas production was up in the last quarter of FY21, it was down again in 1QFY22. Higher international oil prices along with significant discoveries and higher oil and gas production are what drive earnings for the sector.

Attock's cement is popularly known by its brand name Falcon, which is supplied mainly to the southern parts of the country as well as abroad through the sea port. Main exporting markets include Sri Lanka, Mauritius, Sudan, India, Tanzania and Somalia. Through a series of expansions, with the latest line added in FY18, the company boasts a production capacity of 3 million tons. Its market share in the south is around 25 percent or more. The company was started with an initial capital outlay of Rs1.5 billion and a foreign exchange component of $45 million. The company is currently running three manufacturing plants at its facilities. \nAttock also made investments in a cement grinding unit in Iraq through a joint venture with the Iraq-based Al Geetan Commercial Agencies to form a subsidiary, a limited liability company. Attock's holds 60 percent of the company. The mill has a capacity of 0.9 million tons at a cost of $24 million. \nACPL is part of the Pharaon group has a range of investments in the areas of oil and gas, power generation and information technology. Aside from Attock cement, the group also includes Pakistan Oilfields Limited (1950), Attock Refinery (1922), Attock Petroleum Limited jointly established by the Pharaon Investment Group Limited Holding (PIGL) and Attock Oil Group of Companies (1995). Pharaon also took over National Refinery Limited (NRL) in 2005. \nIn terms of shareholding, Pharaon Investment, which is the holding company of ACPL held more than 84 percent shares in the company in June 2018 (FY19 annual report is not out yet). The rest of Attock's shares are distributed between banks, DFIs, Modrabas, Mutual Funds and institutional investors. The public held 4.92 percent of the company's shares in that fiscal year. \nAttock has significant market share in the south and faces limited competition. It has been operating at maximum capacity for a number of years now and its brand recognition ensures it a solid space in the market. The company enjoys proximity to the port which in periods when domestic demand declines can help in shifting focus towards exports. Its cost compared to many cement manufacturers in the north are also lower as it can get its imported raw material and fuels at lower freight. \nThe south zone enjoys higher cement retention prices because of regional dynamics. Lower competition in the region allows cement manufacturers to charge higher prices. During times of lower domestic demand, the company was able to favor its sales mix toward exports. The company's margins not only depend on off take and prices (which have moved upwards) but also the cost of imports and the exchange rate. International coal prices can also hit the company's margins when they moved upwards while a depreciating rupee makes these imports expensive. \nDuring FY18, for instance, rupee's depleting value against the dollar raised costs and significantly affected margins. Attock's margins that had strengthened previously during FY15 and FY16 (at 40%) on the back of high demand and stable costs, dropped to 31 percent during FY18. \nSince the introduction of line-3, the company has been exploring markets such as Bangladesh, Kenya, Tanzania, and Sri Lanka for the export of clinker, according to its official report. Attock's exports share in its sales during FY16- FY18 came down from 39 percent to 19 percent because of fast growing domestic owing to a growth in real estate commercial and housing sectors as well as infrastructure development. \nClinker exports have grown by 15 times in 9MFY19 against last year. During this period, exports were 45 percent of total sales, which was improved on the back of the new production line becoming operational as domestic demand waned. In FY19, Attock's revenues grew by 26 percent according to the PSX notice. However, margins came down to 23 percent owning to higher costs of production. Coal prices averaged a few dollars higher than the previous year while the rupee has depreciated by over 30 percent since July-17. \nRising costs of borrowing, and higher distribution expenses owing to greater exports also grew the company's expenditure-increasing to 13 percent of revenues against 10.5 percent in FY18. Further monetary policy tightening will put pressures on the expense side of the P&L and squeeze profit margins. Meanwhile, coal prices and the expensive dollar will hurt gross margins. \nIt is also worth noting that clinker exports fetch lower prices than cement exports and domestic sales. Sales mix leaning toward clinker isn't the best for margins either. \nAs for domestic demand, austerity has slowed down private as well as public sector spending in development and infrastructure. This is not expected to change much as the new fiscal year kicks in. The company will likely be growing its reach to market overseas which is a good contingency plan if any.

Refinery sector has been in shambles even before coronavirus pandemic struck; slower economic growth in the two fiscal years (FY19 and FY20), leading to lower overall petroleum consumption along with the furnace oil crisis, and the crashing oil prices in 2020 have created a challenging environment for the refineries. And with Covid-19 in 2HFY20, the sector\u2019s profitability was hit hard due to huge inventory losses.

NRL yesterday posted a further decline in losses from Rs2.9 billion to Rs823 million year-on-year. However, the decline mainly stemmed from 2QFY21 where the company\u2019s earnings turned positive after a long time. On the other hand, losses doubled year-on-year in 1QFY21, which was due to inventory losses from both the fuel and the lube segment.  Weak margins on petrol and diesel continue in the second quarter as well but what might have helped NRL in 2QFY21 could be a turnaround in the lube segment. Lube segment incurred loss in 1QFY21 due to increase in feed cost and decline in prices of products. Also, slow demand for bitumen due to lower spending on infrastructure projects resulted in the blocking of funds in inventory forcing the company to finance the operations through short term finance. The situation might have eased in 2QFY21 as the lockdown restrictions were removed and infrastructure activities resumed. Also, lower inventory losses are likely the reason for improved performance in 2QFY21.

In addition to Mari Gas Field, it holds development and production leases as well as operatorship of exploration blocks, and is also a non-operating joint venture partner with leading national and international E&P companies D&P leases and exploration blocks. Starting of as a key supplier of gas to the fertilizer manufacturers, it also is a supplier of gas to the power generation companies and gas distribution companies; while its crude oil and condensate are supplied to the refineries. The government of Pakistan has around 18.39 percent shareholding in Mari Petroleum, with divestment plans on the cards since a long time that have recently been shelved now. Apart from that, Mari has two key shareholders: Fauji Foundation with 40 percent shareholding; and OGDCL with a share of 20 percent. Over the last few years, Mari Petroleum Company Limited has seen rising crude oil production and relatively stable gas production flows. Its revenues and earnings have been on an upward trajectory over the past 6-7 years. In FY16, the revenues increased by 12 percent year-on-year due to sale of 60 mmcfd additional gas under incentive price provided to Guddu Power Station along with overall increased hydrocarbon production. At the same time, the exploration and prospecting expenditure increases two times on a year-on-year basis. FY17 was another good year as revenues continued to increase by 30 percent along with 51 percent, year-on-year increase in incomes. The company\u2019s performance over the years had seen its operating expenditure come down consistently - from 46 percent of sales in FY12 to 26 percent in FY17. The company\u2019s strategy has been to increase production of oil and gas to take maximum benefit of the incentive offered in the 2012 Petroleum Policy on enhanced production of gas from the existing reservoirs, by at least 10 percent. In FY17, Mari Petroleum witnessed 18 billion cubic feet of incremental. In FY18 the company witnessed highest ever production rates and profits. During the year, MARI made one new hydrocarbon discovery in its operated blocks and also completed one appraisal and one development well during the year. In terms of production, Total production as up by 5 percent year-on-year in FY18. The company was able to further enhance incremental production as planned. The company\u2019s gross sales exceeded Rs100 billion for the first time in the history of the company. Its net profit jumped by 68 percent year-on-year. In addition, the finance income also supported the earnings for FY18. FY19saw higher crude oil prices on average. But what has been the key factor to increase the oil and gas exploration and production companies\u2019 profitability was the currency depreciation. Mari Petroleum Company Limited announced a hefty increase in its earnings for FY19 \u2013 58.2 percent year-on-year due to increase in net sales and finance income, and somewhat controlled operating expenditure. Growth of 17.5 percent year-on-year in gross sales came from better gas volumes sold as well as increase in wellhead/consumer gas price. And the increase in exchange gains further lifted the bottomline. Growth in profits however, was cut short by increase in royalty expenses and exploration and prospecting expenditure, which were higher due to higher drilling activity. FY20 was marked by the impact of Covid-19 and depressed oil prices for the oil and gas exploration and production companies. Mari Petroleum\u2019s gross sales increased by around 8 percent. Adjusted for taxes, cess and duties, the net revenue of the company was up by almost 21 percent year-on-year. Growth in the company\u2019s revenues was solely due to the increase of around 20 percent in gas wellhead prices and currency depreciation. Oil and gas production were down by 8 and 2 percent year-on-year respectively during the year. Its bottomline grew by over 24 percent year-on-year. Where revenue growth helped boost earnings for Mari Petroleum, higher exploration and production expenses during the year contained the growth. The company witnessed 2.5 times increase in exploration and prospecting expenses. FY21 in comparison to FY20 came with some revival in the E&P landscape. Mari Petroleum Company Limited announced a 4 percent increase in its earnings for FY21. Where the 1HFY21 posted growth in earnings, the company\u2019s earnings slipped slightly in 3QFY21 due to drop in oil prices negatively impacting the gas wellhead prices. This was followed by another positive last quarter despite the drop in oil prices continuing. However, in spite of the weakness in prices, topline growth was supported by better hydrocarbon production flows in FY21. Mari\u2019s overall oil production in FY21 stood up by 17 percent year-on-year, while natural gas production was up by 8 percent year-on-year during the year. The growth in E&P\u2019s earnings was fueled by weaker exploration and production expenses that declined due to absence of dry well. However, drop in other income and rise in finance cost did the opposite. The E&P giant kept it stable as FY22 began. The decline in gas wellhead prices was offset by rise in gas production. With a share of 21 percent in the country\u2019s gas production, Mari\u2019s gas volumes grew by one percent year-on-year. The oil production for Mari Petroleum was up by over 60 percent year-on-year. Mari Petroleum\u2019s revenue for 1QFY22 was up by 2 percent year-on-year, while its bottomline was flat at Rs9 billion. Exploration and prospecting expenditure was another factor in restricting earnings growth for the company. The E&P expenses grew by 43 percent year-on-year during the quarter, which also increased exploration expenses\u2019 share in total revenue from 6 percent in 1QFY21 to 8.4 percent in 1QFY22. Mari also recorded other income of Rs18 million in 1QFY22 against other expense of Rs507 million in 1QFY21. The company has diversified into mining business by investing in National Resources (Pvt.) Ltd (NRL), where MPCL shareholding in the project is 20 percent. The company also won the offshore exploration license in Block 5 of Abu Dhabi as part of the consortium with ADNOC where the first spud in the block is expected to commence in FY23.

The PPA is expiring in June 2019 and the petition is to extend it till June 2024. Someone should ask the company that in 22 years of operation they have earned on all the equity invested, why are they asking for 15 percent return on equity for another five years. There is a supply glut coming in south and there is no rationale to extend the PPA by five years for a plant that is producing expensive energy. This space has repeatedly highlighted that there is case of excess capacity and the need is to novate some of the upcoming plants in NTDC system to KE to dilute the capacity charge per unit. For details read \" This is the first PPA expiring, which is to be followed by Gul Ahmed plant in Nov 2019 and a few others including KAPCO in years to come. The case in hand is important as it is to set the precedence. Hence, it has to be kept straight for future referencing. There is no way to extend the PPA on 'take or pay'; and even 'take and pay' does not make sense. It is beneficial for KE to buy from Tapal Energy even in case of 'take and pay', as the distribution company can use its existing network to keep on buying electricity. The fuel cost is a pass through item and the cost has to be borne by the consumers. In case of transferring upcoming plants to KE, the company has to invest in network expansion, which would be good for the country- and consumers, but may not suit the distribution company. There are a number of new plants coming online in the south and the capacity charge of all these would be either paid by consumers, or become part of the growing circular debt. One plant of 330 MW is under test run in Thar, and by this year end 660 MW will be added by two plants in Thar. Already a 1320 MW plant on imported coal is online at Port Qasim. Time is not far for first phase of China Hub power plant [660MW] to become operational. Apart from these, two nuclear plants of 2,200 MW will be online by 2021, and around same time, three plants each of 330MW will be functioning in Thar. Also, Lucky 660MW Port Qasim plant is in the process too. Not to mention that there is huge renewable potential in the South as well. Phew, with all these capacities coming online amid the power consumption not increasing in proportionality, it is highly advisable to let go of the old expensive plants. The government is going to increase tariffs and that might result in dip in demand - the slowdown is already visible for Feb\u201919 consumption numbers - down by 4.2 percent. A few may economise consumption while others may move to solar. Hence, a big no to extending any PPA. And even the proposed tariff of the plant is wrongly computed in the tariff petition. Its misleading; they have used RFO base price at Rs42,282.71/Ton while the current price is Rs68,241/Ton. So the current fuel cost works out to be Rs15.2/KWh as against reference of Rs9.37. Total tariff likewise increases to Rs17.2/ KWh as against reference tariff of Rs11.44/KWh.

Growth in KAPCO\u2019s bottomline did not come from the topline as the revenues of the company decreased by 34 percent year-on-year.  The decline in the IPP\u2019s revenues does not come as a surprise as the ongoing pandemic and the slowdown in the economy has resulted in subdued demand for power and electricity. The IPP\u2019s revenues for FY20 were down by around 29 percent year-on-year with over 50 percent decline in 4Q alone; and in 1QFY21 the IPP\u2019s topline slipped by 34 percent primarily due to lower dispatches of electricity to WAPDA by over 20 percent as well as over 35 percent drop in RLNG prices year-on-year during the quarter. However, KAPCO\u2019s load factors have been better than the other key IPPs as it is multi-fueled operated that has also been run on RLNG.  For the first two months of FY21, KAPCO\u2019s plant operated at 50 percent load factor versus 64 percent in 2MFY20. However, decline in power consumption in September due to changing weather might have resulted in lower utilization levels for KAPCO in September 2020. Decline in revenues also resulted in lower operating costs, while the currency depreciation also helped lift the gross profits by 11 percent year-on-year, and gross margins by around 10 percentage points. Administrative costs grew moderately, but the other income witnessed a decline due to lower interest rates during the quarter. This decline in interest rates was also a key factor that propelled growth in KAPCO\u2019s bottomline as the company\u2019s finance cost came down by 61 percent year-on-year.  The IPP\u2019s have come under fire as a result of the government\u2019s investigation, which has also affected the investor interest in the IPP sector. Also, KAPCO\u2019s power Purchase Agreement with WAPDA is close to expiration (2021), while receivables continue to rise. However, KAPCO\u2019s performance to start FY21 has been upbeat where the company also announced an interim cash dividend of Rs1.5 per share for 1QFY21.

This, however, might be the only good news for the company as no one likes the IPPs right now.  Growth in KAPCO\u2019s bottomline did not start form the top as the revenues of the company slipped by 16 percent year-on-year in FY20. The primary reason for the decline in topline was lower dispatches of electricity in FY20. The electricity sold or dispatched to the company\u2019s only customer \u2013 WAPDA was down by 29 percent year-on-year in FY20; and by over 55 percent in 4QFY20 alone. This did however help lift the gross margins.  The IPP\u2019s operating profits and net profits were then supported by other income that surged by 51 percent year-on-year on account of a rise in overdue receivables; and subdued finance cost, respectively. Both the gross and net margins almost doubled in FY20 versus FY19.  However, that is all for the investors who might have little interest left in the IPP for various reasons including the fact that the company did not announce any interim dividend for the 4QFY20  Also, since IPPs have come under scrutiny, it looks like the good days for them are far behind. KAPCO\u2019s power Purchase Agreement with WAPDA is nearing expiration (2021), which means that with how the IPPs have performed in the recent report on the sector as well as their significance on the merit order leaves little juice in the sector. Despite the sizable growth in KAPCO\u2019s earnings, headwinds for IPPs have increased manifolds recently, which also include lower electricity sales amid furnace oil curtailment, and rising receivables.  But KAPCO has a few things that could turn the tide in its favor which would favor the PPA renewal. First KAPCO is a multi-fuel fired power plant, which is better thana single fuel power plant, and the company has shown this by using LNG as a fuel. And second, some experts believe that the IPP still has a useful life of 5-10 years beyond the PPA expiration.

Giving the background of proposal, the sources said Cabinet Committee on Energy and Economic Coordination Committee of Cabinet, on September 24, 2020 approved the report of the Implementation Committee (IA) which was mandated to convert the MoUs signed with IPPs into binding agreements. The Cabinet has ratified the decisions of Cabinet Committee on Energy (CCoE) and Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of Cabinet in their decisions of December 15, 2020 and approved the report along with Master Agreement and Power Purchase Agreement with Kapco, an independent power producer privatized under the applicable privatisation laws but operated outside the typical power generation policy framework for Independent Power Producers (IPPs). The concession framework for the purposes of privatization was prepared and approved by Privatization Commission and accordingly the Facilitation Agreement and GoP guarantee with Kapco were signed by the Privatization Commission on behalf of the President, at the time of its privatization, on June 27, 1996. For the purposes of execution of the Master Agreement and PPA amendment agreement, in terms of the MoU agreed with Kapco, any amendments in the Facilitation Agreement thereto were to be signed by the Privatization Commission. On November 26, 2020, Power Division, in a letter communicated this position to the PC however, Privatization Commission,  on February 11, 2021 responded that due to certain procedural impediments the proposed amendments could not be prepared and signed by designated official of Privatization Commission  and requested that, in respect of Kapco being an IPP, any further agreements or amendments to the Facilitation Agreement and GoP Guarantee should be signed by the Power Division/PPIB. In order to convert the MoU into legally binding agreements, Managing Director, PPIB on behalf of the President of Pakistan, signed the amendment to the Implementation Agreements and Guarantees for all other IPPs as a package to give effect to scheme of novation of the Power Purchase Agreements from WAPDA/NTDC to CPPA-G. In this  instant case WAPDA has signed Third Amendment to the Power Purchase Agreement and Master Agreement with KAPCO whereas a novation agreement has already been signed amongst WAPDA, CPPA-G and KAPCO; however, the effectiveness of such agreements is contingent upon the execution of amendments of the Facilitation Agreement and the Guarantee. Power Division has proposed that it would, therefore, be expedient that in view of position taken by Privatisation Commission (PC), such amendments to the Facilitation Agreement and guarantee are also executed by the Managing Director PPIB on behalf of the President of Pakistan and portfolio of the project is also entrusted to PPIB. In this regard, Section 5(2)(9) the Private Power & Infrastructure Board Act (VI of 2012) (the PPIB Act), vests power to the Federal Government to entrust any power or function to PPIB to meet the objects of the PPIB Act. As the Facilitation Agreement and GoP guarantee was approved by Cabinet, any amendments thereto are also required to be approved by the Federal Government along with the authorization of Managing Director PPIB to sign, execute and deliver it. In the existing scenario, the following proposals may be considered by the government: (i) draft amendment to the Facilitation Agreement  and draft amendment to the Guarantee; (ii) the portfolio of the project may be withdrawn from Privatisation Commission and  entrusted to PPIB, as one-window facilitator, along with all relevant record in terms of Section 5(2)(q) of Private Power & Infrastructure Board Act (VI of 2012); and (iii) the Managing Director PPIB, or in his absence Director Legal PPIB, may be authorized to sign and execute the  amendments to the Facilitation Agreement and the Guarantee on behalf of the President of Pakistan.

This also pulled overall gross margins for KAPCO.  Barring the CPP adjustment, revenues for KAPCO decreased by three percent year-on-year due to lower RLNG prices despite better or higher output in FY21 overall.

The PSO is to receive Rs36 billion from the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and the government of Pakistan. Government is to pay Rs10.16 billion on account of price differential claims.  The company is also to receive Rs5.3 billion on account of exchange loss on the FE 25 loan.

This was announced by SAPM on Power and Petroleum Tabish Gauhar in a statement.  \"I am pleased to inform that the first payment transaction, approved by the government of 40% to 20 IPPs amounting to Rs 89.2 billion has been completed in coordination with SBP [State Bank of Pakistan] and Power Division. \"This shows our commitment to resolve this longstanding issue on a permanent basis, he added. According to the proposal approved by the ECC on May 6, 2021 and ratified by the Federal Cabinet in its meeting held on May 18, 2021, the government had pledged to pay 40 per cent of agreed amount as first installment to 35 IPPs. The sources said, minutes of the Federal Cabinet have been received by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) and Ministry of Finance and paper work is being completed to pay due amounts of 35 IPPs. According to an official statement, Finance Ministry says that in compliance with the directives of the Prime Minister and under guidance of the Finance Minister, the government has completed the first payment transaction of 40% to 20 IPPs amounting to Rs 89.2 billion equally divided in cash 5 years\u2019 Sukuk and 10 years\u2019 PIBs. Finance Division has completed this transaction in coordination with relevant organisations/departments including State Bank of Pakistan and Power Division. The government had assured the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that payments of Rs 180 billion will be made to 47 IPPs as first installment before May 31, 2021 but this was delayed due to ongoing investigation against 12 IPPs of the 2002 policy. It subsequently delayed the final approval of the Cabinet. The government has to pay a cumulative amount of Rs 403 billion to 47 IPPs by December 2021. As per the agreement, the government had to pay agreed amounts to the IPPs by March 29, 2021. The first installment of 40 per cent is duly divided into cash, PIBs and Sukuk and would be adjusted against power sector subsidy claims for the FY 2019-20 and 2020-21. Similarly, disbursement of the remaining 60 per cent will be taken care of in the next financial year.  Power Division has sought a Rs 90 billion supplementary grant to pay 40 percent agreed amount to IPPs established under the Generation Policy 1994 and the Generation Policy pre-1994. The ECC has constituted a committee on this proposal so that a permanent mechanism is devised to ensure payment to the IPPs as per the agreements. Power Division has also proposed that payments to all IPPs under the Power Policy 2002, which have signed agreements pursuant to MoUs may be withheld till the conclusion of NAB investigation and suspend the process of signing ASA with IPPs under the 2002 Power Policy, and notification of their revised tariff as determined by Nepra till the conclusion of the NAB investigation.   The payment to 12 power projects which have not yet been paid are as follows: (i) Engro Power (gas); (ii) Foundation Power (gas); (iii) Orient Power (gas/RLNG/HSD; (iv) Saif Power (gas/RLNG/HSD; (v) Saphire Electric (gas/RLNG/HSD; (vi) Halmore Power (gas/RLNG/HSD; (vii) Hubco Narowal (RFO); (viii) Atlas Power (RFO); (ix) AGL Power (RFO); (x) Nishat Power (RFO); (xi) Nishat Chunian (RFO); and (xii) Liberty Tech (RFO). The sources said IPPs established under the 2002 Policy have also approached the \"facilitators\" and requested them to use their influence on NAB for early issuance of validation letters so that payments are made to them.

The CE of the company argued that in accordance with the provisions of the PPA, Kapco formally notified the power purchaser to enter into good-faith negotiations for the renewal of the PPA in June-2019 and has since then been continuously pursuing a consent letter. Unfortunately, the matter has not been concluded due to various reasons including the pandemic (Covid-19) as well as reasons attributable to the power sector of Pakistan. He further claimed that Kapco has been continuously supporting the system by providing the necessary required power despite its overdue receivables from the power purchaser being in the tens of billions of rupees. \u201cWe have conducted a comprehensive study on a plan for its remaining and technical life which suggests that it can be operated for at least another 10 years,\u201d he maintained. Keeping in view the condition of the plant, flexibility of fuel, system constraint, the company is confident that it can still play/contribute to national interest at very attractive and beneficial terms. In addition, Kapco\u2019s switchyard is being used by the power purchaser/NTDC for 220kV-132kV step-up/step-down facility, irrespective of generation from Kapco power plant.  The timely conclusion of the commercial arrangements will ensure its availability to serve (including switchyard).

Subsequently, Ministry of Energy (Power Division) through its letter of  September 27, 2021 required that a comprehensive analysis should be prepared by NTDC and a report duly approved by NTDC Board of Directors be submitted to Ministry for consideration, the response of which is awaited. In this regard, CPPA through its reminder of June10, 2022 again requested NTDC to provide its analysis and recommendations for renewal/ extension of PPA with Kapco considering its system requirements. \u201cThe exact requirement of the Kapco power plant in the system is to be determined by NTDC on the basis of comprehensive study; however, based on the GM (SO) letter and recent plant utilization, the plant is expected to be utilized to maintain grid system operational requirements in the foreseeable future,\u201d said CEO CPPA-G.  After explaining current status of the matter, CEO CPPA-G has stated that CPPA will proceed further under the terms of Master Agreement for extension/ renewal of PPA, once a comprehensive study along with analysis and recommendations for renewal/ extension of PPA are received from NTDC. CPPA-G; however, has advised Kapco that it can proceed with filing of its tariff application to NEPRA as per NEPRA\u2019S rules and regulations. Accordingly, NEPRA will decide whether to determine its tariff or otherwise the mode through which plant can participate in the CTBCM. Earlier, CEO Kot Addu Power Company had stated that some of the lending banks have withdrawn credit lines whereas some have reduced credit lines. The PPA of June 27, 1996 (as amended from time to time) was entered into at the time of the company\u2019s privatisation in 1996 along with a number of other agreements (facilitation agreement, GoP sovereign guarantee, Gas Supply Agreement (GSA), Oil Supply Agreement (OSA) etc). The term of the PPA is 25 years (and following the settlement of a liquidated damages dispute with the Power Purchaser) is set to expire on October 24, 2022. In accordance with the provisions of the PPA, the company formally notified the Power Purchaser to enter into good faith negotiations for the renewal of the PPA in 2019. However, matters have not progressed due to disruptions caused by the pandemic (COVID-19) in early 2020 and thereafter for other reasons attributable to the power sector of Pakistan. The government and the power purchaser, while negotiating and agreeing to the terms and conditions, explicitly undertook and stated in the Master Agreement of February 11, 2021, to assist and support the company in getting tax exemption similar to other IPPs after the initial term of the PPA and subject to the completion of legal and corporate formalities, issuance of the consent to the extension of the PPA for an additional term. According to Kapco, inordinate delay in renewal of the PPA is a matter of grave concern for the company, despite the fact the company is being dispatched at high levels during this period and the power purchaser/ system cannot afford disruption/ stoppage of power generation from the company\u2019s power plant. Kapco claims that it has continued to fully support the system by providing the necessary required power while accepting higher (negative) late payment charges payable to fuel supplier.

Generation licence of KAPCO was set to expire on September 21, 2021. The company, in accordance with applicable regulations, duly filed an application before the NEPRA for renewal/ extension of its generation licence for a period of ten years. The regulator provisionally allowed KAPCO to continue to generate and supply electricity to the Power Purchaser/ national grid under the obligation of its existing generation licence pending its final decision. NEPRA sought comments from different stakeholders, and key stakeholders (including NPCC, NTDC, MEPCO, etc.) gave favourable comments for extension of the generation licence. A public hearing was conducted by NEPRA on March 31, 2022 on the KAPCO\u2019s generation licence application. The power company has already generated and supplied electricity well in excess of the forecast of the Indicative Generation Capacity Expansion Plan (IGCEP) during the current period due to system requirements which further strengthens the critical importance of its power plant in the system. According to the Chief Executive, notwithstanding KAPCO\u2019s desire to enter into commercial operations it is in the interest of the Power Purchaser/ System operator/ GoP/ NEPRA that the generation licence be renewed, for the following reasons: (i) KAPCO has ten multi-fuel fired Gas Turbines, five Steam Turbines, and ten Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSG); (ii) KAPCO\u2019s Power Plant also consumes LSFO produced by Attock Refineries Limited (ARL). This not only provides backup fuel in case of gas shortage, but also ensures continuation of ARL operations;(iii) KAPCO\u2019s Power Plant is situated at a key location to the National Grid with 12 transmission lines, six each on 132 KV and 220 KV interconnected through having a transformation capacity of 500 MVA;(iv) power complex has a maintained black start capability to support quick recovery in case of transmission collapse.  The capability has been demonstrated successfully over the years and in the recent blackouts;(v) power complex has one of the most extensive fuel oil storage facilities in Pakistan of 156K MT of LSFO and 40M litres of HSD, which ensures fuel/ energy security for the country;(vi) A 32-km dedicated 10-inch diameter fuel oil pipeline from PSO\u2019s Lalpir Depot to the power complex with a capacity of 3,800 MT per day.  The power complex also has a facility for direct decantation of road tankers as well;(vii) six fuel oil treatment plants (the largest facility in Pakistan) to treat furnace oil for burning in the gas turbines; and (vii) there is a well-connected gas supply network through three pipelines - two 16-inch pipelines from SNGPL network have 400 MMSCFD and one 12-inch pipeline from Dhodak with a capacity of 80 MMSCFD. The CE maintained that it is a recorded fact that NTDC, NPCC and MEPCO have stated that KAPCO generation is critically required for support of 132 KV & 220 KV grid system. KAPCO Power Complex is being dispatched at high levels to meet NPCC demands, ensure grid stability and to alleviate the level of load shedding in the country. He claimed that delay in extension of generation licence is causing considerable hardships for company. It has obtained credit lines worth billions of rupees to bridge finance the payment defaults of the Power Purchaser and to support the system. Some of KAPCO\u2019s lending banks have withdrawn credit lines and some have reduced their credit lines. Standard Chartered Bank and Habib Metropolitan Bank have recalled their banking facilities on account of the uncertainty and non-renewal of the generation licence and have advised KAPCO to repay their respective facilities by the end of June 2022, he said, adding that reduction in banking lines reduces the ability of KAPCO to support the System requirements. The company has informed the regulator that cancellation/ withdrawal of credit lines will constrain KAPCO to require the Power Purchaser to settle outstanding receivables forthwith, which may lead to making a call under the GoP guarantee. \u201cDue to the uncertainty/ delay, KAPCO\u2019s financial statements may be qualified by its external auditors for the financial year ending June 30, 2022. KAPCO is a KSE 100 index company on the Pakistan Stock Exchange having over 60,000 shareholders. A significant number of shareholders are small shareholders and it is especially incumbent on KAPCO to protect their interests,\u201d Butt maintained. KAPCO has also argued that qualification of financial statements will not go down well with the stock market price, lending banks and other stakeholders. The power company said that inordinate delay in extension of the Generation Licence is a matter of grave concern for it. KAPCO is being dispatched at high levels during this period and the Power Purchaser/ System cannot afford disruption/ stoppage of power generation from the KAPCO\u2019s Power Plant. \u201cIn case of further delays and consequential revoking of facilities such as financing, fuel supply, human resource, licensing, statutory, it would be extremely difficult to recover operations at short notice,\u201d he said, clarifying that KAPCO has provided all information/ explanations satisfactorily and NEPRA Authority under its mandate and obligation, needs to protect the interest of all the stakeholders in a timely manner.

He informed that it was discussed and decided in the last Committee meeting that CEO, GENCO-I will submit the rehabilitation plan to the NEPRA but the latter has not received it yet.  The chairman Committee observed that committee has taken up the matter of extension of KAPCO and discussed in detail since four months. He asked in what capacity extension to KAPCO was granted, and why have the transactions not been blocked after the expiry of its tenure. He further asked about the details related to the capacity and energy payments made to KAPCO after the extension of contract.  The vice chairman NEPRA informed the Committee that payments were made by the CPPA-G and NEPRA has no role in it.  A payment of Rs57 billion had been made to KAPCO on the selling units at Rs19.5/unit along with the variable payment; however, no capacity payment was made after the expiry of its tenure. The KAPCO had been made minimal payment with strict tariff rules on the take-and-pay method.  The Committee unanimously decided and directed the NEPRA that payments must be withheld and the details of all payments made to KAPCO be submitted to the committee in extended period. The chairman Committee asked about correspondence made with CPPA-G and KAPCO at the time of extension. The vice chairman NEPRA informed that a regulator correspondence had been made with the NEPRA from July 2021 till January 2022 on the issue. The Committee unanimously decided and directed the NEPRA to submit the details of correspondence made with CPPA-G and KAPCO at the time of extension to the Committee till date. The chairman Committee further stated that the Committee has discussed it several times about the tariff and capacity payments made to the IPPs. He stated that the public sector power plants were easily being put on take and pay and all IPPs are on take or pay. When KAPCO contract was extended whether the NEPRA bounded that their tariff will be in Pak rupees, he asked. He further asked why the NEPRA was not taking any action against the illegitimate contract extension of KAPCO and why not a petition has yet been filed.  The vice chairman NEPRA informed that in the case of KAPCO plant, the NEPRA has decided that if utilized on take and pay or take or pay the capacity payment will not be made to KAPCO. The chairman Committee asked when this decision was taken. The vice chairman NEPRA informed that determination was under process and decision will be taken soon. The chairman Committee observed that when the NEPRA was not taken on board for the extension then how they have decided to put KAPCO on take or pay or take and pay.  He lamented that it is clear that the extension was made with the understanding of the NEPRA and the Power Division and undue favour of the KAPCO. The Committee members expressed their dissatisfaction over answers by the NEPRA authorities. The Committee observed that electricity problems in the country cannot be resolved if the Power Division will continue to work in such a delayed and non-serious manner. The chairman Committee observed that when there was excess electricity in the country then there was no need to taking electricity from IPPs especially from KAPCO when their agreement time had already been completed.  The vice chairman NEPRA informed that KAPCO cannot be put in the Economic Merit Order with Rs19.8 per unit cost. When there will be a need to take the electricity from them, then it will be taken. He further stated that KAPCO Power Plant is on take and pay instead of previously take or pay and the contract was extended without capacity payment. The vice chairman NEPRA further briefed the Committee in detail about the economical renewable energy projects under construction.  He stated that earlier, it was briefed to the Committee that there are three plants of 150MW with tariff of Rs8 per unit.

However, the actual upliftment by the power plants has been significantly less in comparison to Power Division demand, as well as, customer demand during this period. During this period, only 545,000 MTS product has been uplifted from PSO against supply plan of 1,044,000 MTs with shortfall of approx. 400,000 MTs whereas Power Division demand for this period was 1,406,000 MTs. As a result, PSO has been facing severe ullage issues to offload its cargoes causing excessive demurrages and upliftment from refineries has also been badly affected in addition to the cash flow issues faced by PSO. The sources said in the view of demand and upliftment scenario and the demand received from Power Division and customers, PSO has also firmed up its supply plan for the month of September, 2022. Based on available fuel oil stock, local refinery avails and previously awarded two HSFO cargoes (deferred from August first fortnight to end of August and September first fortnight respectively) PSO has not awarded any additional HSFO or LSFO cargoes for the month of September, 2022.  Based on the existing considerable variance in demand vs upliftment during this period, PSO has requested to revisit the plant wise RFO requirement shared for the month of October, 2022 in its letter of August 25, 2022. \u201cPSO has sought response / update from Power Division in this matter for RFO requirement with plant-wise break-up for Nov 22 \u2013 Dec 22, enabling PSO to firm up its supply plan accordingly keeping in view of import cycle of minimum 60 days. Accordingly, PSO\u2019s tentative HSFO/ LSFO supply plan September, 2022 for its contractual customers is as follows: Hubco\u2019s demand was 80,000 MT whereas Power Division demand was 10,910 MT which is being met. The demand from Lalpir/ Pakgen was 58,000 MT against demand of 71,400 MT of Power Division; however, PSO will supply 58,000 MT. Furnace oil demand of Kohinoor Energy was 9,000 MT whereas Power Division forwarded demand of 16,374 MT. PSO has met demand submitted by the power plant (customer). PSO will supply 5,000 MT to Muzaffargarh (Genco III) and 10,000 MT to Jamshoro (Genco 1).

The sources maintained that total demand of HSFO placed by customers was 181,000 MT, against Power Division demand of 163,000, whereas PSO will supply 116,916 MT. The demand from Kot Addu Power Plant (KAPCO) was 140,000 MT whereas PSO will supply 60,000 MT despite demand of 44,850 MT placed by Power Division. KAPCO cancelled cargoes of first and second fortnight for the month of September.  Total demand of PSO\u2019s RFO was 321,000 MT for September whereas PSO will supply 176,916 MT against demand of 208,352 MT placed by the Power Division. PSO only supplied approximately 91,661 MTs against the revised supply plan of approximate 188,164 MTs with a shortfall of approximate 96,503 MTs during the month of August, 2022 due to upliftment/ order placement and delay in payments from various power plants. As a result, PSO has been facing ullage constraints to offload its cargoes, and upliftment from refineries was also affected.  PSO maintains that tentative supply plan for September is subject to timely payment or orders from respective Genco\u2019s/ IPPs. Any deviation from this will affect supplies to customers.  PSO maintains that customers receipt may vary from daily plan due to transit time. Supplies from Karachi have 2-3 day transmit time. In addition to tentative supply plan, K-Electric has placed firm demand of 116,000 MTs for the month of September, 2022.

The Committee, attended by Senator Syed Shibli Faraz, Senator, Senator Saifullah Sarwar Khan Nyazee, Senator, Fida Muhammad, Senator, Prince Ahmed Umer Ahmedzai, Senator, Zeeshan Khanzada and Senator, Sana Jamali supported Chairman Standing Committee in recommending Power Division to send the case of Guddu plant to National Accountability Bureau (NAB) or Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), whichever is the authorized investigation agency as the Board is also complicit in this case. The Committee observed that CPGCL Board members, who are now too old, are sitting in different boards of GHCL since 2004. \u201cSend me compliance of Committees\u2019 directives today positively,\u201d directed Chairman Standing Committee to Additional Secretary Shakeel Qadir Khan who assumed charge on Monday and was not aware of power sector\u2019s issues. He apologized on a couple of occasions for his ignorance of prevalent power sector issues and promised to brief the Committee in its coming meetings.  The Committee also directed Power Division to terminate Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Genco Holding Company Limited (GHCL) Muhammad Imran, who was present in the Committee meeting despite being suspended by the Power Division. Chairman Standing Committee, who did not allow the \u201csuspended\u201d CEO GHCL to speak during meeting, accused him of extending his term by \u201cmanaging\u201d the Board. \u201cThe suspended CEO GHCL is sitting in the committee meeting, which is slap on the face of the Power Division which issued his orders,\u201d Chairman Committee remarked. Abro in a taunting way stated that when the Prime Minister can complete the Metro Bus project in three days and wants to complete Diamer Basha project in a few months, then why is the CEO GHCL not under his control? The Committee, dominated by PTI Senators, was furious at the absence of Minister of Power, Khurram Dastgir Khan and Secretary Power, Rashid Mehmood Langrial and sought presence of both in the meeting of the Standing Committee.  Power Division\u2019s team informed the Committee that Secretary was in Finance Ministry to discuss the strategy for the seventh IMF review.  Senator Shibli Faraz, who is the author of a report on IPPs, commented that energy sector is one of the top two or three issues of the country adding that the power sector has mortgaged sovereignty of the country, which is against the interest of Pakistan. Senior Joint Secretary Power Division suggested that the government should not be involved in commercial activity and handover the power sector to the private sector. On the issue of extension of over 360 days in PPA to Kot Addu Power Company (KAPCO) Chairman Senate Committee directed Chairman NEPRA to share the regulator\u2019s correspondence with the Power Division/ CPP-G on extension in the pact without its approval. Chairman NEPRA briefed that the government reached an out of court settlement with the company to avoid payment of Rs 90 billion and is getting electricity without making capacity payments.  He also stated that the main reason for load shedding in the country is non-payment to power companies by the government. He maintained that presently installed capacity is 38,000 MW but generation is around 18000 MW as power plants are not being paid their energy claims. During discussion, Chairman Standing Committee claimed that the incumbent government has started uninterrupted electricity even on those feeders in Sindh where losses are 100 per cent. According to an official statement, the Committee was briefed on matters related to promotions from LS-II to Assistant Engineers, revision of tariffs by NEPRA and extension of KAPCO contract up to October 2022. It also took up the matter of actions to be taken up against CEO GHCL, Members of Board of Directors (BODs) GHCL & JPCL related to Independent Inquiry Report of construction and damage of 747MW (GT-14 plant).  The Committee showed serious concern regarding inaction of the BOD against those involved in the damage of the 747MW (GT-14 plant). Referring to letters that were sent out on March 31, 2022, with directives of suspending those involved in the damage of 747MW Plant, the Committee showed displeasure against non-implementation of instructions and directed the Power Division to take immediate action. The Committee termed the BoD complicit to the massive irregularity and said that the matter must be thoroughly investigated and legal action must be taken against all concerned.  The Additional Secretary Ministry of Energy (Power Division) assured the Committee of compliance.  While reviewing the matter of promotion of SEs, LS-II to Assistant Engineer in all DISCOs the Committee was informed that all related procedures, as per GHCL letter of May 9, 2022 & 10 May, 2022, would be complied by all DISCOs by the end of this month. The Committee directed that a Compliance Report must be submitted to the Committee in this regard. Discussing Chairman NEPRA stance on petition pending before NEPRA for revision of tariff of GENCO-I and an update regarding the recommendation of the Committee for operating the GENCO-I Power Plant on LNG instead of Furnace Oil, the Committee was informed that there were three options: RLNG, RFO and Gas. The matter of circular debt was taken up and the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) was directed to submit a circular debt report to the Committee every month with comparison with corresponding months during the tenure of the previous government.

The Authority conducted public hearing May 31, 2022 during which the officials of CPPA-G, National Power Control Centre (NPCC) and National Transmission Despatch Company (NTDC) were quizzed on different accounts.  NPCC/NTDC during the hearing explained operation of power plants on RFO, however, the Authority observed that an in-house analysis has also been carried out to work out the financial impact due to deviation from EMO based on the information submitted by NPCC.  As per the in-house analysis/workings carried out, the net amount deductible, on provisional basis, from the overall claim due to deviation from EMO is Rs580 million (Rs578 million financial impact due to system constraints and Rs2 million due to underutilization of efficient power plants).  The Authority decided to deduct this amount provisionally in the instant FCA, until NPCC/NTDC and CPPA-G provide the required details along-with complete justification in this regard to the satisfaction of the Authority. During the hearing, CPPA-G and NPCC also agreed to revise the EMO list that is posted on their website to exclude the RFO, Gas and RLNG power plants which are not supplying energy to CPPA-G due to lack of availability of fuel. Further, while reviewing the FCA claim, the Authority observed that Partial Load was provided to Baloki, QATPL and Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy (Private) Limited (HSRPEL) power plants even during Forced Outages and Failure to Achieve Despatch (FADL), which is non-performance/fault of the said power producers.  The Authority is of the considered view that Part Load can only be provided if the Plant is available but NPCC despatches it on part load due to system requirements. Similarly, Part Load cannot be provided in the case of Failure of the plant to achieve the Despatch instructed by the NPCC. Therefore, an amount of Rs85.702 million (Rs16.796 million for QATPL, Rs68.547 million for Balloki and Rs0.359 million for HSRPEL) for the month of March 2022 has been deducted on account of Partial Load charges, while working out the FCA of April 2022. The Authority from the information/data submitted by CPPA-G and NTDC/NPCC observed that the first most efficient RLNG power plants in Pakistan power sector are the Quaid-e-Azam Thermal Power Plant (QATPL), two power plants of National Power Parks Management Company limited at Haveli Bahadur Shah (HBS) and Baloki; efficiency of these power plants is above 61 percent. It is encouraging that utilization of three most efficient RLNG power plants has increased: QATPL is around 77pc, HBS around 84pc and Baloki around 80pc.  Although their utilization factors have increased but still the accumulated claim by these power plants against part load operation is Rs1.74 billion. In the wake of high load demand in the system and ongoing electricity shortfall in the country, the full utilization of these power plants could minimize load-shedding through generation of electricity by cheaper resources on one hand while on the other hand it could help avoid part load charges of Rs1.74 billion. The Authority also noted that the second most efficient RLNG power plants in Pakistan are the Orient, Saif, Sapphire and Halmore power plants; efficiency of these power plants is above 51 percent. The utilization factor of Orient, Saif, Sapphire and Halmore on RLNG fuel was 61pc, 42pc, 43pc and 64pc respectively. Similarly, the utilization factor of Saif Power and Sapphire Electric on HSD was around 16pc and 15pc. Operation of these power plants on part load resulted in part load adjustment charges claim of more than Rs422 million. Like the aforementioned RLNG power plants full utilization of these power plants was also necessary to minimize the load-shedding through generation of electricity by cheaper resources and avoid the part load charges of Rs422 million. The Authority further observed that the utilisation factor of power plants at Central Power Generation Company limited (CPGCL), including the newly commissioned Guddu 747 machine, remained very low despite availability of dedicated cheaper gas. Low utilisation factor of machines at Genco-II has resulted in operation of costlier power plants. The utilisation of inefficient Genco-I (JPCL) and Genco-III (NPGCL) power plants that too on RFO fuel, while leaving the efficient power plant unutilised or underutilized, was undesirable and resulted in higher Energy Purchase Price (EPP) during the month. Similarly, the use of HSD in operating dual fuel Sail Power, Sapphire Electric, KAPCO Block-I and KAPCO Block-2 power plants was undesired and has resulted in increased EPP during the month. The per unit cost (Rs/kWh) as well as the utilization factor (%) of various thermal power plants clearly indicate the need for better management to improve the situation of electricity generation and cost control within the available resources. The Authority considers that importance should be given to improve the planning by NTDC i.e. accurate (best possible) estimation of RLNG requirement that too well before time and operation of the power plants in strict merit order to reduce the burden of higher EPP. The Authority further noted that currently, the fuel cost adjustment is determined with a lag of one month, the FCA for the month of April 2022 is being determined in June 2022. The FCA, either upward or downward, has huge financial impact both for the power sector as well as consumers and must be passed on as early as possible to ensure the revenue recovery for Discos and benefit to consumers in case of downward adjustment. Therefore, efforts must be made by CPPA-G to submit FCA data immediately after the month for early determination by the Authority. The Authority, after incorporating the aforementioned adjustments, has reviewed and assessed an increase of Rs3.9923/kWh in the applicable tariff for Discos on account of variations in the fuel charges for the month of April 2022. Member Sindh, Rafique Ahmad Shaikh, in his dissenting note stated that as per the data submitted by NPCC, the average RLNG allocated to power sector during the month of April, 2022 was 552 mmcfd against a demand of 690 mmcfd that resulted in indicative financial impact of Rs2,379 million during the aforesaid month. During the FCA hearing of Discos for the month of April, 2022, the reason for not utilising the efficient RLNG power plants appears to be non-availability of RLNG. One reason for shortage of RLNG was lesser demand by NTDC/NPCC i.e. requisition of around 690 mmcfd against the actual demand of around 800 mmcfd (as apprised by the system operator to the Authority), the other reason is less supply of RLNG by concerned quarters against the demanded quantity of RLNG. Efforts should have been made to improve the supply chain of RLNG to fully utilise the most efficient RLNG power plants and avoid the part load adjustment charges. As the RLNG is imported fuel and its availability can be ensured through better supply chain management, accordingly, such mis-management into the availability of required RLNG can not be passed on to the consumers.

According to the decision sent to Federal Government for final approval and notification, Nepra said that based on discussions, information submitted by CPPA-G, adjustment requests filed by Discos and keeping in view the aforementioned adjustment, the amount of quarterly adjustment for the first Quarter of FY 2021-22 has been worked out as positive Rs 14.337 billion on account of variation in capacity charges, variable O&M, Use of System Charges (UoSC), Market Operator Fee (MOF) and FCA impact on T&D losses. The Authority also noted that CPPA-G in its data included an amount of Rs 1.856 billion on account of capacity charges of KAPCO. The Authority noted that KAPCO\u2019s PPA was amended by CPPAG, wherein it was agreed that the plant will be operated without payment of capacity charges from July 2021 onward and only energy charges would be paid. Upon inquiry from CPPA-G regarding inclusion of capacity charges of Rs 1.856 billion of KAPCO, it has been submitted that claimed cost is on account of adjusting costs pertaining to previous periods i.e. May 2019 to June 2020 as per the PPA, however no proper justification/documentary evidence has been provided. Therefore, while working out the quarterly adjustment, the entire amount of Rs 1.856 billion on account of capacity charges of KAPCO has been provisionally withheld. The Authority will consider this amount in the subsequent quarterly adjustments, once CPPA-G provides complete details and justifications of the claimed amount. After going through Discos\u2019 case and available data, the Authority has determined a positive uniform rate of Re0.5715/kWh, for the allowed positive amount of quarterly adjustments of Rs 14.337 million pertaining to the first quarter of FY 2021-22, across each category of consumers of Discos (except lifeline consumers), based on notified projected sales, after excluding there from the sales to life line consumers, to be recovered in three months - from June 1, 2022. Member Sindh, Rafique Ahmad Shaikh in his dissenting note observed \u201cbasis for periodic adjustment in tariff for first quarter of FY 2021-22 is being placed before Authority in April 2022- very delayed case.

NPCC has written a number of letters to Power Division and other concerned ministries about criticality of fuel stocks but arrangements were not made by the previous government nor the incumbent government, due to which the entire country is facing massive loadshedding. According to sources, NPCC has apprised the government that due to severe heat wave prevailing in the country, the system load demand has increased drastically. Consequently, power plants are being operated at full capacity to meet system load demand in addition to load management due to generation shortfall. This has resulted in excessive fuel consumption and fast depletion of fuel reserves (RFO/ HSD& coal) due to less replenishment as compared to consumption. Power plants have time and again communicated their apprehension regarding their inability to maintain obligatory fuel stock on account of non-payment by CPPA-G.  NPCC has also shared fuel stock replenishment and consumption at different power plants with the concerned quarters. Recently, Sahiwal Coal Power Plant desynchronized unit # 02 (621 MW) on May 16, 2022 in addition to operation of unit # 01 on part load (330 MW) causing outage of 912 MW from the complex on pretext of low coal reserves.   Moreover, China Hub coal inventory is also depleting very fast which may eventually lead to generation outage from the complex. This will further aggravate the situation causing severe capability shortfall. The total capacity on forced outage due to fuel shortage and technical fault as on May 16, 2022 was 4,933 MW. Of this, 3,572 MW capacity is under forced outage due to fuel shortage from May 16, 2022. RLNG capacity of 1,050 MW is out from system since May 5, 2022, GTPS Faisalabad (5-9) 120 MW from December 13 2021, Jamshoro power plant 649 MW from April 18, 2022, Muzaffargarh 840 MW since April 8, 2022, Sahiwal coal unit- 1 292 MW, and unit -2, 621 are non-operational since May 16, 2002. The sources said, 1,361 MW electricity is on forced outage due to technical fault which includes Port Qasim unit-2 of 621 MW since May 7, 2022, Uch-I, 195 MW since May 15, Genco-II (85 MW TPS Guddu unit -5) and Genco-II (90 MW TPS Guddu-8), since May 14. There is no definite date for these plants to restart operation. However, Genco-II (370 MW unit 14 of Guddu 747 MW) which is shut since February 12, 2021, is expected to be start operation from June 15, 2022. NPCC argues that due to schedule outage of K-2 (for refueling), variability in RLNG supply to power sector and high system load demand, the availability of coal fired and RFO/HSD based power plants is of vital importance for the smooth operation of power system, and has requested the government to advise CPPA-G for necessary payments to all power plants well in time for building up their fuel stock as per their relevant PPAs and to avoid severe generation capability shortfall and additional load management in the ongoing scorching heat wave. The availability of fuel stocks on following power plants is far less than their requirement: (i) Hubco 3,849 tons; (ii) Kapco (LSFO) 12, 275 tons; (iii) AES Lalpir, 5,609 tons; (iv) AES Pakgen, 1,250 tonns; (v) SABA, 1,678 tons; (vi) Atlas Power, 1,265 tons; (vii) HubcoNarowal, 2,383 tons; (viii) Liberty Tech, 3,880 tons; (ix) Nishat Power, 123 tons; (x) Orient Power (HSD) 1,214 tons; (xi) Halmore (HSD) 1,914 tons; (xii) Kapco-III (HSD) 41 tons; and (xiii) Baloki (HSD) 3, 169 tons. Meanwhile, PSO has apprised the government that it has not received any confirmation by MoE (Power Division) regarding fuel requirement for June-August, 2022 till date. Furthermore, as per letter no. 4(50)/2021-NTDC forwarded on May 06, 2022 LSFO demand is 131,907 MTs for the month of June, 2022, whereas KAPCO has confirmed to scrap the cargoes via letter of May 10, 2022 for the first fortnight (01-15) of June, 2022 and accordingly PSO will not award any LSFO cargo for the first fortnight and supply volume for the month of June 2022 will be reduced proportionally. PSO has requested Power Division to confirm the HSFO requirement for the month of June, 2022 by May 12, 2022 enabling it to firm up its supply plan in order to avoid any untoward situation. Last week, Power Division informed the Federal Cabinet that an unprecedented rise in international fuel prices had resulted in a substantive rise in the cost of generation. The price of coal, in particular, had increased from 9100 per M ton to $300 per M ton (May 22 US$ 300/M ton). To maintain the supply chain of coal, Rs 100 billion was required as an additional supplementary grant as equity in former WAPDA electricity Discos, over and above the budgeted and approved subsidies. This additional supplementary grant would be used to pay imported coal-based IPPs against their overdue payables for timely procurement of the coal inventory. The Cabinet was informed that in case the required supplementary grant of Rs.100 billion was not approved, further purchase of coal inventory would be suspended till such time that international coal prices were substantially lower. This disruption of coal supply chain would result in stoppage of the IPPs (3900 MW). Consequently, about two-hour system-wide load-shedding would have to be scheduled in the month of June, three hours in July, and four in August. The Federal Cabinet set up a Sub-Committee on Energy, under the chairmanship of Minister for Power to prepare a viable plan for load-shedding during the coming summer months, keeping in view the financial constraints. The plan to be submitted within 10 days, shall strike a balance between the proposed load-shedding duration in the urban and rural areas.

The government has already started unscheduled load of electricity in the country due to less supply of fuel to the power plants. The sources said electricity demand was on the rise due to hot weather but at the same time 800-900 MW free electricity from K-3, has been suspended due to a fault in the plant which triggered shortfall of 1000 MW, which has now been reduced to 400 MW. \u201cIf current fuel supply situation continues in the days to come, it would be very difficult to ensure uninterrupted supply of electricity in Ramazan,\u201d said an official on condition of anonymity. According to Secretary Energy, KP, there is a law and order situation in Lower Chitral and Upper Chitral due to 12 to 22 hours long load shedding.  People in Peshawar are also on the streets against prolonged unscheduled load shedding. However, Minister for Energy Hammad Azhar argues that there is no unscheduled load shedding in the country. \u201cNo unscheduled load shedding. Demand and supply is balance. Revenue-based load shedding only,\u201d he said while replying to a question sent by this correspondent.  On Tuesday afternoon, generation was 16790 MW which was equal to demand, except revenue-based load shedding. According to sources, recently, Central Power Purchasing Agency-Guaranteed (CPPA-G) wrote to the government that it was facing serious financial crunch due to low recovery from power Distribution Companies (Discos). CPPA-G requested the ECC to approve Rs 150 billion to clear overdue payments of coal-fired power plants, mostly owned by the Chinese companies, but the forum approved only Rs50 billion as Tariff Differential Subsidy (TDS) after Finance Ministry refused to support the proposal, citing financial woes. CFO, CPPA-G has stated that due to poor cash inflows/ remittances from DISCOS to CPPA-G, the overdue payables to CPEC projects amounted to Rs256.8 billion as on March 29, 2022. In this regard, ECC has already approved release of Rs100 billion in two tranches for payments to CPEC projects out of which Rs50 billion had already been paid to the CPEC projects. The current raise in the fuel prices has further added burden on the cash flow. He has requested the Power Division that release of Rs50 billion, the second tranche, be arranged as supplementary grant through MoF on urgent basis for onward payment to CPEC projects. Pakistan State Oil (PSO) has also made it clear that it cannot ensure supply of furnace oil to non-contractual consumers (IPPs). According to PSO, it has supplied 27,224 MTs fuel oil and will supply approx. 17,500 MTs to its contractual customers including Lalpir, Pakgen and KEL and 9,000 MTs to non-contractual customers including Saba Power, Liberty Tech and Nishat Chunian in remaining days of March, 2022. In addition to this volume, 44,000 MTs has been supplied to K-Electric and approx. 45,000MTs will be supplied to K-Electric in remaining days of the current month. However, PSO has stated that it will be responsible for the supply/ dispatch of fuel oil to its contractual customers. The supplies to non-contractual customers will be made on best endeavour basis and subject to availability of fuel oil. PSO\u2019s receivables have also reached the whopping level of Rs 650 billion as IPPs and Gencos are not clearing their due payables.

The company has requested Power Division to issue a No Objection Certificate (NOC) to the Company to import around 5,000 Metric Ton RFO from OMC of their own choice. Nishat Power has cited reference of a CCoE decision taken on June 18, 2020 in which it decided that private IPPs may be allowed to import RFO through PSO or other OMCs after getting a NOC from the Power Division, \u2018which shall consult with Petroleum Division to ensure all local RFO is consumed first keeping in view the demand and supply situation.\u2019 General Manager, Engineering, KAPCO, in a letter to CPPA-G stated that PSO has intimated the tentative price of LSFO cargo will be around Rs 205,080/ MT inclusive of GST. This implies that price of generation from KAPCO\u2019s Energy Block-1 will be Rs34 per unit on LSFO and Rs 30.7 per unit on HSD whereas the generation cost of Energy Block\u20142 will be Rs 37.7 per unit on HSFO and Rs 33.8 per unit on HSD in March. In April 2022, generation forecast from KAPCO will be 468 GWh, which requires 98,000 MTs of HSFO whereas in May, 2022 generation forecast is 482 GWh, which needs 100,000 HSFO as no RLNG has been allocated to the plant.  However, KE, in its letter states that summer period has already started in Karachi and accordingly the power demand has increased, significantly. However, the gas supply to KE is still restricted at 95 MMCFD as compared to 152 MMCFD supplied to KE in the month of March and 257 MMCFD in the month of April last year. The power utility was of the view that as Ramazan is fast approaching it would be crucial for KE to operate SGTPS, KGTPS and Korangi CCPP plants to provide uninterrupted power supply to the people of Karachi.  KE has urged SSGC to increase the gas quota immediately to at least 190 MMCFD in line with the CCoE decision and maintain gas pressure at SGTPS (2.5 bar), KGTPS (2.5 bar) and KCCPP (4 bar) to fulfil the operational requirements of these plants.
